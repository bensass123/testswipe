His latest EP, Unarmored, digs a few layers deeper into an already genre-crossing career. From folk, to funk, to southern soul — Sam captures it all on his sophomore release.\n\n“…Burchfield’s music is soulful.  That is the perfect word for it.  It doesn’t just describe his genre  – it describes the heart of the artist himself…”\n\n-Emily McBride - VINYL MAG\n\nUnarmored was a collaboration with Burchfield’s band, building the tracks around his carefully crafted songs and fleshing them out on the road and in the studio. The EP is a sonic journey that jumps from folk love songs like ‘Spring’ to horn-driven jams ‘Accidentally Cute’ and ‘Don’t Forget My Name.’ \n\n“This EP was definitely about uncovering and discovering my own sound and direction. The name Unarmored fits because it’s me sort of laying bare all of the different styles that are floating around my head. There’s also a few tracks that are pretty intimate and personal that bring that vulnerability home a little bit.”\n\nSam and the band have made ripples in the southeast US, opening for soul-phenom St. Paul & The Broken Bones, pop act Ben Rector, and growing a loyal fanbase the old-fashioned way with a powerful live show. Discover the new record Unarmored and keep your ears open for what’s next from this young talent."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Gays of Sunshine Comedy Hour","date":"08 23 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1520773","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1520773-gays-sunshine-comedy-hour-charlotte/","desc":"Kia McCall-Barnes, also known as Kia Comedy, is an Atlanta based LGBTQ comedian who is currently touring with her signature “Queer Comedy” shows.

It marked the beginning of 13 years of relentless touring, while working 60 hours a week as a lawyer. \nHe made nine more albums before he burned out and stopped performing in 2007. “I ran into a brick wall, burned out from the touring, drinking, staying out late and my work schedule.” Childers sat in a chair for a few months before having a spiritual awakening. “I wanted to investigate God. I dove into the Quran, but I grew up with the Bible and began reading. It helped me understand the spiritual consequences of the things I was doing. I became happier and more at peace. Now, I try to set an example with my life and be decent to other people.” \nHe started playing music again in 2010, recording two albums, Glorious Day (2010) and Next Best Thing (2013) with the Overmountain Men, a band that Avett Brother bassist Bob Crawford – a huge fan and close friend of Childers’ - helped produce. “David is the most prolific North Carolina songwriter alive,” Crawford said. “Everywhere I go, people ask about him.

The group's name stems from each member’s distinct home suburb in Birmingham, Mountain Brook and Bluff Park. \n \nOriginally an acoustic duo, the pair quickly became a staple at local venues, turning heads with clean vocals and expert guitar work. Still searching for the right musicians to create a full band, the duo released “The Rough Cuts,” a 3-song acoustic project, in the fall of 2015.\n \nIn the spring of 2016, John Canada noticed the talent and potential of the duo and offered to play percussion and sing with Joseph and Alec. Soon after, he officially joined the group, expanding their sound with driving rhythm and an added voice. The trio instantly locked in and started playing together consistently. After resolving to make something of this ensemble, the trio searched for a bassist to fill the bill. Rip Britton completed The Brook & The Bluff on bass in the summer of 2016. \n \nNow fully equipped, The Brook & The Bluff is passionate about sharing their original music with Birmingham and beyond. The band is working on its first full project and excited about taking the next step in their musical progression.Joy, Bethany and Alex all met as children in a theater company and stayed in touch over the years but never would have imagined how deep their friendships would eventually become. All three band members were taught piano by Alex’s parents, all three went to the same university and all three shared the same views on politics and cats, yet it was over a decade after meeting until they started making music together. Bethany and Alex started playing together as a duo in 2015. Joy was in between bands at the time and started singing occasionally with them. Bethany and Alex quickly realized how natural it felt with Joy in the mix and started sharing the stage with her more and more until all three agreed that making music as a trio was the only option that made any sense anymore.\n\nNow the three are all but inseparable (Bethany and Alex are set to be married in the Fall of 2017 and Joy is the maid of honor) and the music coming out of the trio is more complex, ambitious and focused than ever. Their second EP “Bones” releasing Summer 2017 is a launching pad into their 2nd US Tour and beyond.Tahoma crosses over the thresholds of lucid, harmony-based folk, and classic, compelling Americana Rock. Emblematic of artists like Ryan Adams, My Morning Jacket, and Tom Petty,Tahoma boasts a flawless blend of indie-rock, Americana-soul, and classic rock n’ roll.The Austin, TX group’s newest single “Emerald Ring” perfectly emulates the band’s transformation from wine-sipping romantic folk to definitively, classic American rock music. The first single from the group’s upcoming record (set to be released in June 2016), “Emerald Ring” is an expression of lead singer, Brandon Aguilar, “coming to terms with what kind of songwriter I think I am”. Superbly written lyrics, detailing the painfully natural process of human growth, coupled with tasteful, melodically crafted guitar riffs places Tahoma into their own distinct realm of hybrid Americana Rock. Joining Aguilar is Sarah Oermann on backing vocals/percussion, Vinnie Fallico on lead guitar, Mark Mayfield on bass, and Clellan Hyatt on drums. Oermann’s soulfully chilling harmonies coupled with Fallico’s electrifying, gritty guitar licks makes for an eye-turning, energetic sound reminiscent of 70’s LA country rock legends Jackson Browne, Joni Mitchell, and The Eagles.While the group still maintains a fingerprint of their older, folk roots from their debut Honest Mark EP, Tahoma has re-crafted their sound with a live, full band in mind. When asked of the group’s progression, Aguilar noted “it’s always been easier for me to write a rock song... that’s more me at the very core.” With a full length album set for a August 2016 release, Tahoma is geared up, and ready to showcase their distinctly unique brand of Americana Rock to audiences everywhere."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"NoDa Neighborhood & Business Assoc.

Originally conceived as a duet, Benjamin and Ashley quickly dedicated themselves to carrying the tradition of the American troubadour - hopping trains and hitchhiking across country while delivering their unique brand of original songwriting and tragic storytelling.\n \n      In the summer of 2011, while performing on the streets of Nashville, Tennessee, Benjamin and Ashley met Nicholas and Shannon Ridout, two skilled musicians traveling from the Pacific Northwest. Immediately inspired by each other’s music, the two groups began writing collaboratively and soon formed the band Spit Shine. The four musicians quickly built a friendship stronger than family, and together poured their blood and sweat into the music of Spit Shine. For the next two years Lost Dog Street Band took a hiatus, until Nicholas’s tragic death in the spring of 2013.\n \n       Pushing through the sorrow at the loss of their best friend, Lost Dog Street Band was resurrected with a fervency. Now doing very little street performing, Lost Dog Street Band tours the country each year, delivering their story through song in venues nationwide. Along the way they keep Nicholas’s work alive by sharing his music at the end of every show they play. They have since added a third member, longtime friend and drummer, Ivan Doertshuk.\n \n      Drawing from years of lonely tramping, and more than one tragic loss, Lost Dog Street Band has crafted a distinct sound that is best described as ‘dark country’ that never wavers from its roots and honors the traditions of its forbearers. In the same vein as country-legend Guy Clark, Benjamin Tod weaves his melodies and lyrics together to offer listeners an unapologetically raw and authentic account of the human experience.Dead Cat is an original country quartet from Charlotte, NC.  Born several years ago from a rainy day and a broken heart, then roommates, Cat Glenn and Desmond Landry wrote their first song “Go.”  The tone was set for this band’s poignant reflection of lovesick country that was carried by Cat’s soulful voice, and Desmond’s wailing dobro.  After being asked to play a few shows and being well received in the Charlotte area, Cat and Desmond decided to record an album.  They asked friend and fantastic musician Geoff White (David Childers, Appalulcia) to accompany them and were honored and blessed when he became a full time member of the band.  Matt Davis, friend and fellow bluegrass lover, became another vital addition in 2015 on stand up bass. \n            Through years of love and loss, Cat found an outlet in singing and songwriting.  With a voice that possesses a serene sadness and touches on some of life’s most critical hardships, Cat has been able to bring forth a deep emotional core to her music. Though the content is at times melancholy, Dead Cat pushes an upbeat, catchy country sound that keeps you tapping your feet.  Dead Cat was awarded “Best Country Artist” in 2016 Creative Loafing.  Dead Cat finished their first full length album in summer of 2017, which is set to release in October of the same year."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Find Your Muse Open Mic with Margo Cilker","date":"08 28 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 8:00 pm ","ticketfly":"1520891","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1520891-find-your-muse-open-mic-margo-charlotte/","desc":"Find Your Muse Open Mic is Charlotte's premier open mic night.

What distinguishes this gifted trio from earlier generations of Tuvan throat singers is the subtle infusion of modern influences into their traditional music. One can find complex harmonies, western instruments, and contemporary song forms in Alash’s music, but its overall sound and spirit is decidedly Tuvan.\n\n\nTrained in traditional Tuvan music since childhood, the Alash musicians studied at Kyzyl Arts College just as Tuva was beginning to open up to the West. They formed a traditional ensemble and won multiple awards for traditional throat singing in international xöömei competitions, both as an ensemble and as individuals. At the same time, they paid close attention to new trends coming out of the West. They have borrowed new ideas that mesh well with the sound and feel of traditional Tuvan music, but they have never sacrificed the integrity of their own heritage in an effort to make their music more hip.\n\n\nAlash first toured the U.S. under the sponsorship of the Open World Leadership program of the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Arts. Since then they have returned many times, to the delight of American audiences. The Washington Post described their music as “utterly stunning,” quipping that after the performance “audience members picked their jaws up off the floor.”\n\n\nAlash enjoys collaborating with musicians of all stripes. They appear as guest artists on Béla Fleck & the Flecktones’ holiday CD Jingle All the Way (2008), which won a Grammy. The Denver Post remarked, “As electrifying as the Flecktones’ performance was, the band were nearly upstaged by Alash Ensemble.” Alash also enjoys a longstanding musical partnership with the legendary Sun Ra Arkestra, and they have collaborated with musicians across the spectrum, from country to classical to beatboxing.\n\n\nBeyond performing, Alash has a passion for teaching and promoting understanding between cultures. Their tours often include workshops where they introduce Tuvan music to students from primary, middle and high schools, colleges, universities, and music conservatories. Children as young as 8 and 9 have learned to throat-sing. As one student exclaimed, “Alash opened my eyes to a whole new world!”\n\n\nAlash has released four CDs of its own: Alash Live at the Enchanted Garden (2006), Alash (2007), Buura (2011), and Achai (2015).

Having built a substantial grass-roots fan base through tireless touring and old-fashioned hard work, McConnell is primed for a mainstream breakthrough.\nSean McConnell demonstrates exactly why McConnell has already won such a devoted audience. He writes vivid, forthright, effortlessly catchy songs whose incisive melodic craft is matched by their resonant emotional insight. Such instantly memorable tunes as “Holy Days,” “Beautiful Rose,” “Bottom of the Sea” and “Best We’ve Ever Been” are both catchy and personally charged, conveying an unmistakable sense of personal experience while exploring universal truths.\n\n“This record’s a bit of a step for me,” McConnell asserts. “It’s a real storyteller record, and it’s pretty autobiographical. I’m learning how to be more honest and understated in my writing, and I wanted to match that sonically and vocally. When I look at this collection of songs, I see a lot of nostalgia, and looking back on sacred moments. I’m kind of nostalgic and reflective by nature.”\n\nMcConnell recorded the album in his adopted hometown of Nashville with producers Jason Lehning and Ian Fitchuk, who also contributed keyboards and drums, respectively. The recording took place prior to McConnell signing with Rounder, with the artist financing the sessions himself.\n\n“This project started,” he explains, “when I went to a cabin by myself for a week, with the intention of writing some songs. In that week, I wrote about half of the songs on the record, and I could see the thread of what this record was gonna be. That was exciting for me, because it normally takes me a year to find an album’s worth of songs that belong together. The whole recording process was really fun and liberating, and the energy in the studio was really positive.”\n\nSongwriting and music-making have been a part of Sean McConnell’s life for as long as he can remember. “My mom was a singer and my dad was a guitar player and songwriter,” he notes. “They’d play in coffeehouses and I’d go along and watch them perform, and seeing that lifestyle showed me that music was an option. And seeing my dad painstakingly writing songs had a huge influence on me, and gave me license to feel like I could enter into that world.”\n\nBy the age of ten, he had become proficient on guitar and was writing his first songs. “I fell in love with the instrument first,” McConnell recalls. “Learning guitar gave me a feeling of uncharted territory laid out in front of me. And as I got better on guitar, the songs started to come naturally. At around the same time, we moved from Massachusetts to Georgia, and the first song I wrote was about the feeling of leaving the familiar and feeling lost in a new place. Music gave me a focus and became an emotional outlet for me.”\n\nHis supportive family background helped to instill the confidence and drive to pursue his muse early on. “I started playing in middle school, doing any gig I could get just to get my chops up,” he says. “By high school, I would be doing local gigs and really promoting them, bringing out a couple hundred kids to my shows a few times a month and starting to make a decent living at it. That made me think that maybe I could do this in other towns. So I started traveling around the southeast a little bit, and there was always enough progress to take things to the next level. While I was in college, I did a lot of college touring, just me driving all over the United States in a Toyota Corolla. It was hard work, but it showed me that I could do it.”\n\nMcConnell was just 15 when he self-released his first album, Faces, in 2000. Followed by 2001’s Here In The Lost and Found, 2004’s 200 Orange Street, 2006’s Cold Black Sky, 2007’s Tell The Truth, 2008’s The Walk Around EP, 2010’s Saints, Thieves and Liars, 2012’s Midland and the 2014 EP The B Side Session.\n\n“I had a guitar teacher in Atlanta who had a home studio, and he was the first one to say ‘Hey, you should make a record,'” he says. “If I go back and listen to that first record now, the songs are kind of crude, but at the same time there’s a directness about them that I like. My writing has evolved since then, but at the same time I’ve tried to hold on to some of that directness.”\n\n“I’m really attracted to songwriters who just put it out there honestly, and I feel like I’m getting back to basics and expressing things in a simple, direct way on the new album,” he continues. “I’m just trying to learn how to be a more honest storyteller, trying to get my mind in a place where I’m not actually thinking and the music’s just kind of happening naturally. When I read interviews with songwriters that I admire, they always say that the best songs are the ones that just kind of happen, like they’re operating from the unconscious. That’s a place I want to get to.”\n\nHaving spent much of his life honing his craft and paying his dues, Sean McConnell is eager to launch the next chapter of his career.\n“I kind of feel like I’ve been in a really long boot camp,” he concludes. “I’m really grateful for that, because I feel like I’ve gained enough experience to know the deal and be prepared for anything. I’m excited to see where the next part of the journey takes me.”"},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Circus No. 9","date":"09 21 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1542679","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1542679-circus-no-9-charlotte/","desc":"Based out of East Tennessee, Circus No.9 is a new progressive acoustic group that embraces the influence of Bluegrass, Americana, and Folk.

It is the culmination of several years of songwriting and the kindness of thousands of miles and friends. A cast of characters, experiences, and personal perspectives set in simple rhymes and sung in harmony to paint a picture in your mind.\n\nWhen my brother and I started making music as The Cactus Blossoms there wasn’t a big plan. We cut our teeth performing some well known and obscure country songs that were popular or unpopular pre-1960, partly out of curiosity and deep appreciation, but mostly because it was fun. Early on, we were offered a residency at the Turf Club in St. Paul, Minnesota, so we got a band together and it became our weekly “practice-in-public” where we would pull out every song we could think of, no matter how well we knew it. It was our first chance to play all night and do whatever we wanted. Over the course of our year and a half at the Turf Club our repertoire had snowballed into an amalgam of original songs and a bunch of gut wrenching, “tongue-in-cheek” heartbreakers, that were 30 years older than us. Not everyone could tell what was new and what was old, and it didn’t really matter. They just seemed to enjoy it. That’s how the wheel got going and gave the illusion of spin\nning backwards. We weren’t born in the wrong era. We just got into some music from a different era and happened to make it our own.\n\nEvery step of the way we’ve had the good fortune of being offered an opportunity that seems just beyond what we’re ready for. It always stretches us out and makes us feel lucky as hell. When JD McPherson called us up and said he was interested in producing our record it was the latest in a series of serendipitous events that have brought us to where we are today. We had opened for him at a hometown gig in Minneapolis a few months earlier and had met him briefly, but could never have imagined then that within a year we would be recording a new album with his help and criss-crossing America on tour with his band. He’s got the singing voice of an angel, a connoisseur’s taste, the boundless creative energy of a child, a scholar’s mind, and he can hear like a wolf. This guy was the guy. He wanted to do something sparse and rhythmic with simple melodic arrangements and it lined up perfectly with the direction our new songs were leading us.\n\nWe wanted to record live with the best rhythm section we could find, which led us to Chicago where JD enlisted the amazing talents of drummer/engineer Alex Hall, guitarist Joel Paterson, and Beau Sample on upright bass. Three musicians who practice their respective crafts to genius proportions and bring it all to the studio. At the start of our first recording session we barely knew these guys and they barely knew our music. Alex was setting up microphones and running cables while the rest of us were drinking coffee and cracking jokes to wake up. Within a couple hours we had cut the first song for the album, “Queen Of Them All”, and we knew we were in the right place at the right time."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Jesse Jazz Band Jam","date":"09 19 17","times":"\n  Doors: 10:00 pm / Show: 10:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1542668","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1542668-jesse-jazz-band-jam-charlotte/","desc":""},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"David Ryan Harris","date":"09 19 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1513757","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1513757-david-ryan-harris-charlotte/","desc":"You’ve either got soul or you don’t. David Ryan Harris most definitely does. The singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist has built an impressive catalog of soulful stories that instantly captivate.“Soulfulness comes from telling stories in in the most honest and direct way that you can,” he says. “People relate to what you’re saying when you sing from the heart.”\n\nThat’s exactly what Harris has done throughout his near three-decade career.Whether itbe in early bands such as Follow For Now, Brand New Immortals or over the course of six full-length solo albums, he tells stories that resonate. He’s carried this same spirit while producing, writing and/or performing with the likes of John Mayer, Dave Matthews, India.Arie, Cassandra Wilson and Guy Sebastian—with whom he co-wrote the RIAA platinum-certified “Battle Scars”. Most recently, it drove Harris’2015’s Lightyears, which boasted guest spots from John Mayer, India.Arie, and Nikka Costa. Along the way, he received acclaim from All Music Guide, Glide Magazine, Elmore Magazine, Performer Magazine, AXS, Relix Magazine, and many others in addition to performing on Fox, CBS, and The CW in between packed tours. His next chapter unfolds on his 2017 seventh offering,Songs For Other People. The songs were culled from collaborations with a multitude of co-writers over the course of the last year or so.\n\n“I wasn’t really intending to make a record,” he admits. “I had co-written written some songs intending to give them to other artists and there were a few thatjust never found homes. The idea of singing these songs myself was something I’d though about for a little while and slowly I started to get excited at how wide open this project could be. There were no boundaries musically or thematically other than the the fact that these songs are for and about other people.”\n\nIn order to track Songs For Other People, he tapped the talents of drummer Terrence Clark who he met via a YouTube audition, keyboard player Zac Rae, Cellist Keith Tutt and GRAMMY® Award-winning producer Mike Elizondo [Eminem, Dr. Dre, Fiona Apple, Maroon 5] on bass. They cut the album’s seven jams in less than three weeks’ time during 2016.\n\nOn the record, Harrisbrings a pronounced sense of passion and power to pop music. The single “Coldplay” balances delicate clean guitar and airy percussion with his dynamic vocal range, fluctuating from a soft croon to a simmeringand soaring falsetto.\n\n“Basically, the song walks you through the beginning of a relationship until the end, and this girl’s love for Coldplay is the backdrop,” he goes on. “The guy finds the tickets in his drawer, and it immediately brings him back. I think everybody has had one of those ‘Coldplay Moments,’as I like to call them.”\n\nElsewhere, “Kerosene” proves both incendiary and intoxicating all at once as it paints a portrait of “a heartbroken guy who’s drinking kerosene and wants to do some damage.”A clean riff drives the upbeat swing of “Good,” which culminates on the unshakable refrain, “You’re the kind of bad girl that would make a good wife.” With its mellotron hum and narrative lyricism, “Average Joe” tackles longing and regret through a tongue-in-cheek visual. “It’s this dudehiding in the bushes looking at his ex-girlfriend with her new guy,” he adds. “The protagonist doesn’t realize he’s the one who’s average.\n\n”In between returning to the road on guitar duty for John Mayerin 2017, Harris will be performing across North Americaon solo shows. \n\nNo matter what he does, that sense of soul ultimately defines him.“When anybody listens to Songs For Other People, I’d love for them to experience a feeling of escape,” he leaves off. “These little vignettes are relatable, but they’re also a respite. Everyone can relate to heartbreak and love. It’s real.”"},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"The All Organic Comedy Show with Luke Mones & David Spector","date":"09 20 17","times":"\n  Doors: 10:00 pm / Show: 10:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1546431","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1546431-all-organic-comedy-show-luke-charlotte/","desc":"All Organic Comedy Show & Open Mic!

Participate in The \"Bad-Ass\" of the Week, and maybe win a $20 gift card.The music of New Orleans courses through singer/songwriter/pianist Travers Geoffray’s veins like the Mississippi River cuts across the South. His great-grandfather Fernand Maris Geoffray arrived there from Paris in 1910 and played viola for the New Orleans Opera, as did his son Rudolph Cesar, who was good friends with trumpet player Al Hirt. His father was the leader of the USO band while stationed in Vietnam, and passed that musical legacy to Travers, who studied classical, then jazz, piano at the prestigious Levine School of Music in Washington, DC. His solo debut, Highway Kings, is steeped in the sounds of the city where he moved from his hometown of Alexandria, VA, at 18 to attend Tulane University. While still an undergraduate, Travers formed his first band, Mississippi Rail Company, which made its mark with appearances at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Voodoo Fest.\n\nYou can hear the Crescent City in his piano playing, steeped in the classic ragtime-turned- stride styles of Ferdinand Joseph “Jelly Roll Morton,” LaMothe Henry “Professor Longhair” Byrd, Mac “Dr. John” Rebennack, Antoine “Fats” Domino and James Booker, honed under the tutelage of legendary local keyboardist Tom McDermott.\nProduced by Grammy-winning gospel/bluegrass vet Michael Latterel (Jim Lauderdale, Rhonda Vincent] at Nashville’s House of Blues Studio, Highway Kings is about the lures and pitfalls of the open road, stretching like an empty canvas before him, as Travers starts up the engine of his solo career, examining what makes him tick. The new songs were more introspective, varied, and less about maintaining that party atmosphere all night long.\n\n“This album became such an intense and personal project that I felt it had to come out under my name,” he explains. “It sounded like me. And that’s how other people seemed to relate to it. It’s more transparent as the statement of an individual, rather than a band.” Combining the organic Americana roots of Sturgill Simpson, the lyrical depth of Jason Isbell and Tom Waits’ Tin Pan Alley/country-blues hybrid story-telling, Highway Kings’ songs are both literary and cinematic, evoking the epic sweep of The Grapes of Wrath in the title track, with its trip through Oklahoma and “the buffalos on golden prairies up above the Utah sky,” ending up at the “crystal shores” of California. \n\n“I love the mystique of the open road and traveling,” he says. “Many of these songs are not just about physical trips, but the imaginary ones we go on in our heads, because a lot of people can’t just pick up and go when they please.” There are echoes of Cormac McCarthy’s All the Pretty Horses and the Border trilogy in the\nwide-screen orchestral scope of “Ride Out West,” its melodic peak riding a south-of- the-border feel which evokes both Orson Welles’ Touch of Evil and Sergio Leone’s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, a fantasy about being a cowboy, “even when the reality can be pretty cruel.”“McCarthy’s books just hit home for me,” says Travers, who also gleaned some inspiration from a college course he took at Tulane dubbed, “The American Hobo Hero,” where he saw movies like John Schlesinger’s gritty Midnight Cowboy. “His style is just very simple and elegant in writing about the basis of what it means to be human. There’s nothing complicated – just you live, you die and in between, you go where you need to go. Your fate is in your own hands, until it’s not.”\n\nAnd then there are tracks that offer the pure exhilarating rush of the dance floor in the speeded-up, chugging Chuck Berry rockabilly of “Drive” and the ragtime funk of “Mabel,” reminiscent of both The Band at its most downhome and the boozy, tongue-in- cheek playfulness of “Rainy Day Women #12 & 35.” Counterbalancing that are the sepulchral, plaintive “Oh, Alabama” and the dirge-like “Wake,” the former featuring the mournful clarinet of Jeff Coffin, the ex-Flecktone member who now plays with the Dave Matthews Band, the latter a wailing, chilling saxophone solo.\n\nWhat makes Geoffray’s music endure, though, is his commitment to the melodies and harmonies of classic American songwriting tropes, from the musical theater to the Brill Building. You can hear it in the simple pop piano progression on “Don’t Stop,” a song that wouldn’t sound out of place on your local Top 40 station, at least the ones who still play Coldplay or U2. “Hold over my ears magnificent sound,” sings Travers, and that’s exactly what he’s created here.\n\nInfluenced equally by the travels of Harry and Lloyd in Dumb and Dumber, Tommy Callahan and Richard Hayden in Tommy Boy and his favorite childhood comic strip, Calvin and Hobbes, Highway Kings puts the listener in the driver’s seat, behind the wheel and invites us to turn the key.\n\nBy the time, we get to the album closer, “Take Me Home,” a tribute to his sweet Virginia birthplace, Travers admits, “There are times when you have to take off your shoes, eat a warm meal and be with family and friends. It just makes going out on the road that much better.” \n\nAnd that’s exactly where Geoffray will find himself in the coming months. With an appearance at this year’s New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival on tap, he is ready to take his band and play the new songs to see how audiences react. “I walked across temperamental seas/Writing stories never told/Over hills and purple meadows\n/I found heaven on my own,” “Take Me Home” “My biggest goal would be just to be able to get to the point where I can make another record,” he says when asked about future ambitions. I’ve already started developing more material that’s even better. This album helped me develop that process, and I just want to continue mastering it.\n\nIf I can get there, I’ll be happy.” Start the car and drive. This trip is just beginning."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"PigPen Theatre Co.","date":"09 28 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1504523","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1504523-pigpen-theatre-co-charlotte/","desc":"PigPen Theatre Co. began creating their unique brand of theatre, music, and film as freshmen at the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in 2007. Their debut album, “Bremen”, was named #10 album of the year in The Huffington Post’s 2012 Grammy preview sending PigPen on tour playing to sold-out crowds across the country. American Songwriter premiered their follow-up EP, “The Way I’m Running”, in 2013 while the band was playing a series of concerts that became one of the most popular residencies of the past decade at the legendary Schuba’s Tavern in Chicago. In 2015 PigPen released their sophomore album, \"Whole Sun\", performed at Mumford & Sons' return to the Gentlemen of the Road Festival, and made their feature film debut in Jonathan Demme's \"Ricki and the Flash\" starring Meryl Streep. They are currently writing their debut children’s novel and performing Shakespeare's Pericles directed by Sir Trevor Nunn at Theatre For A New Audience in Brooklyn, NY.John Prine forced David Luning to drop out of college. Not at gunpoint or anything—the two had never even met—but the effect of hearing the songwriting legend's music for the first time had an equally compelling effect on Luning, who was studying film scoring at the Berklee College of Music in Boston at the time. Now an accomplished artist in his own right, Luning is preparing to release his most dynamic and gripping collection to date, 'Restless,' and he can trace it all back to one fateful night that changed everything.\n\n\"A couple of friends invited me over to share some songs at their apartment, and that was the first time I'd ever really listened to Americana music or folk or country or whatever you want to call it,\" remembers Luning. \"They showed me John Prine, and it just resonated with me so much. I was like, 'Oh my god, this is what I have to do with my life.' I just figured it out in that moment.\"\n\nLuning dropped out of school almost immediately, moved back to his native California, and devoted himself to songwriting and performing. He worked his way up through open mics to large festival performances, piecing together a band to flesh out his songs along the way and hitting the road to tour with a fierce determination. His self-released debut album, 'Just Drop On By,' garnered acclaim from both critics and fellow musicians alike, with country megastar Keith Urban hailing Luning's \"staunch originality.\" Songs from the album landed numerous film and TV placements, most recently on NBC's 'Grimm,' and Luning's reputation for exhilarating live performances earned him dates with luminaries like Jackie Greene, Dave and Phil Alvin, and Elvin Bishop, along with a slew of festival performances up and down the West Coast. \n\nIf 'Just Drop On by' announced the arrival of a promising new talent, 'Restless' delivers on that potential and then some. Recorded under the guidance of engineer/producer Karl Derfler (Tom Waits, Dave Matthews) and with Luning's longtime live bandmates—Ben Dubin (bass & harmonica), Linden Reed (drums), and Dave Sampson (guitar & mandolin)—the album marks a major step forward, both sonically and emotionally.\n\n\"With the first record, I produced and engineered everything myself,\" explains Luning. \"I'd never worked with an outside producer before, so it was nerve-racking going into the studio with Karl for the first time, but it was just a perfect fit. It was like he knew what I wanted in my music before I even did, and he could push my performances where they needed to go and really take my music to another level.\"\n\nLuning and his band set up shop at the stunning Panoramic Studios in Stinson, California, crafting a darker, grittier vibe for the music and exploring a wider palette than ever before. While many of Luning's songs are inspired by the lives and stories of the men and women he's grown up with in California or met on the road, the lyrics are all filtered through his own unique perspective and reflect his remarkable personal journey. Perhaps no track fits that bill more directly than \"Driftin,'\" an infectious road warrior's anthem that find's Luning singing, \"I wanna keep on drifting like a rambling man.\" \n\n\"I had so much fun on tour going from place to place and playing to new people all the time and I got into the rhythm of it all, so when it ended and we came home I wasn't ready to stop,\" he explains. \"We pulled into Ben's house to unload our gear and I said, 'Ben, we're packing up and we're gonna go somewhere tomorrow right? We're gonna keep on going right?'\" \n\nMuch of the album is uptempo and exuberant—\"Almost Sounds Like Laughing\" is a foot-stomping folk tune with the energy of a runaway train—but Luning shows off his remarkable depth and range on some of the record's more restrained tracks, like the slow-burning \"Brother In Chains\" and delicate \"Gonna Forget About You,\" which finds him pulling his vocals back to an intimate near-whisper that conveys a world of heartache and regret. \"In Hell I Am\" started life as an acoustic blues on a resonator guitar before morphing into a fiery, electric rocker, while \"Bet It All On Black\" takes on a harder, Southern edge, with Luning repeating the mantra, \"Ain't no use in holding back.\" \n\n\"It's essentially about a person who's kind of carefree,\" he says, \"and they know that something might not be the best thing to do, but they're going all in with it anyway. They're just going for it, regardless of the outcome and any repercussions they might face.\" \n\nIf that sounds familiar, perhaps like the attitude of a man who might risk everything to drop out of school and move across the country to pursue a dream, it's no coincidence. With songs this good, it's a safe bet that a restless soul like David Luning is going to keep on traveling for a long time to come."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"\"Candyrat Guitar Night\" featuring Peter Ciluzzi and Spencer Elliott","date":"09 30 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1526141","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1526141-candyrat-guitar-night-peter-charlotte/","desc":"Guitarist Peter Ciluzzi’s music transports listeners on a journey through virtuosic, evocative compositions that tell a story without words.

As a guitar maker, his work has been displayed at a number of exhibitions including the Montreal Guitar Show, and are used by Ciluzzi in his live performances.\n \n \n“Luthier and player, with sublime beauty and taste.” - Minor 7th\n \n“A truly gifted guitarist but foremost a first-class composer and musician…….who is able to touch a person’s soul with so much warmth and impact.” - Bridge GuitarSpencer Elliott began composing instrumental piano music in his early years -- his influences mainly consisting of contemporary composers like George Winston.  It was later that he picked up the guitar, yet he was still more influenced by punk and alternative genres at that time. It wasn’t until 2007 that Spencer turned his focus to progressive steel string guitar. Spencer spent several years taking inspiration from artists such as Hedges, Ross, McKee and Dufour. Once Spencer began to write progressive finger style pieces, his compositional elements pulled not only from his piano background but also from his affinity for edgy guitar music. Spencer views modern finger style as part of the \"Free Space\", to borrow a phrase from Ian MacKaye (singer for Minor Threat and Fugazi and owner of Dischord Records). It is a place where new and original artistic ideas continue to bloom.  These ideas are not produced with profit in mind, but from a desire and a need to create.  Spencer’s compositions possess a cinematic quality, painting rich melodic landscapes that fuse his contrasting influences.\n \n \n\"To say that Spencer’s music has a cinematic quality would be an understatement. This is wordless music that takes you places.\" - Rudy Panucci (Pop Cult)\n \n\"Spencer's music is definitely unique.\" - Antoine Dufour"},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"The BrevetCrane","date":"09 29 17","times":"\n  Doors: 10:00 pm / Show: 10:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1540886","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1540886-brevet-crane-charlotte/","desc":"Passion brought The Brevet together, and it defines their music. Their very name represents a Civil War rank awarded to individuals who went above and beyond the call of duty without the expectation of extra monetary compensation. In other words, The Brevet traditionally act out of their passion for and dedication to music. That spirit courses through their songs, and it’s the reason why they’ve quietly built a palpable national buzz.\n \nSince the release of their 2013 independent debut Battle of the Heart, the quintet—Aric Chase Damm [vocals, guitar], Michael Jones [piano], David Aguiar [drums, percussion], Ben Ross [bass], and John Kingsley [guitar]—has landed high-profile placements throughout film and television, including Apple, The Good Lie, Ashby, 90210, Growing Up Fisher, American Idol, The MLB Network and more. They’ve also earned ink in Los Angeles Times, American Songwriter, and OC Weekly, among many others. Their forthcoming 2016 sophomore effort, American Novel, elevates the group’s rock-tinged cinematic Americana sound to heavenly heights.\n \n“We want to take listeners on a journey with American Novel,” exclaims Aric. “Each song blends into the next, weaving together this adventure. In many ways, it feels like our first album as a defined band.”\n \n“We have so many stories to tell,” agrees Michael. “We try to create an environment for listeners to immerse themselves in.”\n \nThe creative union between Aric and Michael dates back to seventh grade when the two recorded their first CD and sold it to classmates in Orange County. Inspired by their school’s music program, the musicians dove headfirst into learning their instruments, spending countless hours gaining palpable proficiency at a young age. This would start translate into their very first local performances. \n \nBy college, they had begun scoring short films together, drawing on influences as diverse as composer Thomas Newman, Mumford & Sons, Kings of Leon, Bruce Springsteen, and needtobreathe. Following their graduation, the duo officially formed The Brevet, self-producing and recording Battle of the Heart. \n \n“It’s always been a D.I.Y. effort,” says Michael. “This is totally our vision created and presented by us. There’s a purity to that approach that we take pride in.”\n \nIt carried through the sessions for American Novel. Tracked in the community center of a mobile home park a stone’s throw from Southern California’s famed 405 Freeway, they channel a rustic, raw, and real energy throughout the record’s 10 tracks. It’s stitched together by threads of soundtrack-style overtones, rock power, and Americana spirit.\n \nIn between recording, they developed an overpowering live presence. Reflective of their deft musicianship, the shows left audiences singing and stunned anytime they hit the stage. All of this would lay the foundation for their latest body of work.\nThey previewed the album with the three-song CH.1 EP, including the first single “Moving Mountains.” On the track, a gang vocal towers over slick finger-picked guitar, resounding piano, and booming percussion.\n \n“‘Moving Mountains’ inspired us to make this album lyrically,” admits Aric. “It speaks on themes of overcoming. Everything was rooted in that. I was reading a book of Vincent Van Gogh’s journal passages at the time. For someone to have such clarity in his dream in the face of uncertainty and doubt is very inspiring. You’ve got to make your own path and do something you can be proud of. That’s our mantra.”\n \nMichael adds, “You’re working towards creating your own reality and success. It might feel like you have to move something seemingly insurmountable to do so, but it’s not impossible. There’s always a way to overcome.”\n \nElsewhere, “Be Your Man” swings form an expansive chant into a bluesy twang, and “Hold On” builds from a stark and soulful verse into an impassioned refrain.  “People might think ‘Hold On’ about a love interest, but it’s actually referring to holding on to yourself and who you aspire to be,” remarks Aric.\n \nA song of determination, “Hazy Eyes” carries a robust refrain over a driving beat and guitar, while the finale “Upholder” closes everything out with an appropriately epic crescendo. \n \nNow, The Brevet share their passion with the world on American Novel. “I hope we can speak to everyone’s journey,” Michael leaves off. “We’re in this together, and this is the first step.”Best described as crossover music, Crane has a sound that is all his own. Musical influences range across the board, but most prevalent in his current writing would be Soul, Reggae, R&B, and Pop. Hypothetically, you might find him on tour with Jack Johnson, G Love, The Dirty Heads, Allen Stone, or The Neighbourhood. \n\nIn September of 2014, Crane released his first solo endeavor, The \"I Love Women\" EP. The EP was a collaborative effort from himself and producer Marshall Coats. The two put together an all-star lineup of musicians to create a dynamic collection of 5 songs. Some of the song co writes from the EP include Grammy Award winners and international touring artists. \n\nSince the release of the \"I Love Women\" EP, Crane has toured non-stop performing over 250 dates within a year’s time. In the midst of a rigorous live performance regime, he's managed to find himself with a new management team, impressive new content based on the new material, and writing with even more Grammy Award winners and International-touring artists.

Once word got out about Gilbert's stage-owning singing and playing, Shawn Colvin invited him to be special guest on her Fat City Tour. Noted not only for being the ever consummate performer, Gilbert has recorded 12 albums, including 4 for Philo/Rounder Records and a duo album with friend Ellis Paul.

Although many of the songs were worked out at Koch’s barnyard studio in the Poconos, the band returned to Matt Schimelfenig at Philly’s Miner Street Studios to record the record. The collaboration resulted in a diverse output of expertly crafted, hooky pop songs like “Mesa” coupled with sparse, dark, and deeply emotional synth-laden tracks like “World.” Musically, the record captures the quiet moments of crushing vulnerability and the hardened highs of personal strength as expertly as Koch’s lyrical craft.\n\nIf Cayetana’s newest album had a tagline it would be “how to stop self-sabotaging and accept love.” Thematically, the Philadelphia indie rock three-piece - comprised of Augusta Koch, Allegra Anka and Kelly Olsen - has been exploring the delicate interplay of mental illness and wellness, since they began releasing music in 2014, but never so gracefully and poignantly as on New Kind of Normal. “The record is about mental health…struggling with that and settling into a new kind of normal where you can finally recognize your own your destructive behaviors and accept love into your life.” Cayetana explore the concept of normality when living with mental illness, that what you know as normal can be self-destructive, and that finding a new way of living, a new kind of normal, where self-care and self-respect are the norm is an often painful and lifelong process that can feel foreign and undeserving. New Kind of Normal, however, reminds us that self-love is merited and palpable and delivers us a soundtrack for finding it.\n\nSongs like “Certain for Miles,” embody the concept of the record beautifully. Koch sings, “When the world bears down on me will I laugh at it’s audacity and be able to comprehend? When the world bears down on me will I laugh at it’s audacity and be able to start again?” The answer, apparently, is yes and always has been.\n\nFrom the group’s inception Cayetana has exemplified the beauty and spirit of perseverance and DIY. They started as three friends who had barely been acquainted with their instruments and in just three years have become one of the most promising bands in indie music. They prove on New Kind of Normal that growth takes self-responsibility, accepting the help of others, and resilience proving that the risk is worth the writhing. \n\nProving themselves masters of self-actualization, Cayetana has formed their own record label – Plum Records – to release their second LP. Koch says of Plum, “We believe in ourselves so much more than anyone else is going to believe in us, so why not put all of our energy into releasing the record?” Koch is as candid about the financial, emotional and sometimes creative sacrifice that being a musician entails as she is about her own personal internal experiences. For their second record, Cayetana refused to compromise and hope to help other artists to do the same in the future. “We want to empower people and show them that they don’t have to wait for something to happen. They can do it themselves.”\n\nEvidently, there is a new kind of normal not only in the mind but also in music and Cayetana is determined to help us find it.\n\n*Written by Anika PyleHEMMING (Candice Martello) is an acoustic singer-songwriter hailing from Philadelphia, PA.

John Shields and Kevin Shields (of no known relation) comprise the charismatic two-piece as an “interchangeable, indispensable pair in limbo between rapper and singer-songwriter.” 2015 saw the band’s formation followed quickly by their first full length release, Buddha the Beast. Recorded in Philadelphia and Charleston, Buddha the Beast offers a “mashup of electronic beats, surf-ready sounds, and hip-hop…each song is an experience all its own.”\n\nWhat started as a side-project quickly moved into the forefront as the duo’s chemistry on stage and in the studio sparked a unified vision. Prior to Little Stranger, both Shields and Shields fronted their own bands that would go on to share the stage with other notable acts such as Slightly Stoopid, Steel Pulse, Grace Potter, The Heavy Pets, and John Brown’s Body. With years of on-stage experience between them, Little Stranger bring an energy and freestyle approach to each live show, paying mind to the importance of keeping every performance fresh and unique. \n\nWith influences from artists such as Beck, Gorillaz, and Outkast, Little Stranger combine melodic songwriting with hip-hop-inspired lyricism and production, creating a sound that slips into your subconscious after one listen!The members of Charleston, South Carolina’s SondorBlue have the markers of the so-called ‘New Bohemian’ movement – with focus on a healthy lifestyle, brotherly love, and individuality.  From TIME Magazine in the US to THE GUARDIAN in the UK, people are talking about the return to this free-thinking way of life.  While SondorBlue is a rock band writing tight pop songs, they share the relentless touring schedule, the fan culture and the raw musicianship of artists on the ever-expanding jam band scene.\n\nThe band is comprised of three exceptionally talented vocalists who could each easily front their own bands – Connor Hollifield on lead guitar, John Sheehan on guitar and keyboards and Andrew Halley at center stage on bass – with drummer, Drew Lewis holding down a clockwork backbeat.  They come together to create harmonies unlike any you have ever heard. Connor explained of the arrangement “We had all had our own songwriting side projects when we were younger, but when we came together to play music — that's when we were the happiest.”  Sheehan added “I wanted to share this experience with my best friends.  I knew we could go a lot further together than any of us could alone.”\n\nIf longevity for bands is determined by their ability to pull off their recorded material in a live setting, then SondorBlue is set up for a long, fruitful career.  They have been aggressively touring all along the East Coast and make pulling off their complex harmonies and playing their intricate arrangements look easy. The band loves to play live. “It is one of my favorite things,” says Lewis.  “It has been great to watch the songs develop as we take them out of the studio and onto the stage.”\n\n“We’ve been lucky to connect with some great people on the road and they have been enormously supportive,” explains Halley.  \"We’ve been able to replicate some of our experience through social media, and it has been rewarding to engage and keep in touch with everyone we've met along the way.”  It shows - the band’s single, “OPINIONS,” has over 125k streams on Spotify and a track off their 2016 REALOMETER EP release, “The Moon And You,” has over 110k streams.  BuzzArtists called their musical combination “swirling, harmony-driven indie rock,” though you might want to add a touch of ‘pop’ to the band’s ever-evolving recipe.  With YOU WILL FIND LOVE ON ASHLEY AVENUE, the band’s brand new EP, they bring context to their recent hit, “OPINIONS,” by wearing their Beatles influence on their proverbial sleeve.  Gorgeous melodies, harmonies and expert instrumentation are the hallmarks of the other tracks “Escape!,” “A Beautiful Dream,” “I hate living like this” and the single “Ashley Ave.”  \n\nSondorBlue are poised for big things in the future.

The band mates celebrate their 30th anniversary, having formed in Irvine, Scotland in 1987. “I’ve been in the band for thirty years now,” says Livingston. “That’s a long time to be in any relationship. I’s a good time to take stock, see how far we’ve come, and think about where we’re headed.”\nWith six well-spaced full-length albums to their credit, starting with debut Cake in 1990, through last year’s Wild Pendulum, the band has written and released just north of 100 songs. Over the course of the tour, they plan to play each one of those songs. “Now that we’ve reached a century of songs,” says Reader, “it feels like a good time to meet up with them all again, like a high school reunion.” He adds, “Those songs whose love and friendship we’ve nourished over the years will no doubt turn up most nights and show us why we’ve remained so close over the years, but it’ll be most interesting to see how those with whom we’ve lost touch have aged.” He expects that some songs will “turn up drunk and disheveled,” while others “may now be dashing and distinguishing, more so than we all would have guessed. I can’t wait to meet them all again and find out.”\nEvery show will consist of two unique sets and fans can expect to hear some covers, too. Although the band often delves into its back catalog for obscurities, particularly during acoustic tours, many songs have never been played live. Others may never be played again. “We will be playing some songs live that we have never attempted before, so in some ways, it’s a tightrope walk for us. But, these songs are what we have done with our lives, so I accept the challenge and will try to not look down,” says Douglas.\nPerforming acoustically will transport many of those 100 songs back to their origins. “Most of our songs are written with acoustic guitars and voices in quiet, solitary rooms, so it will be nervy but exciting to bring that sound out of the backroom and into the light,” says Douglas. According to Livingston, “touring with no rhythm section means you have to take your cues more from the vocal. You can bend time and create space for the emotion of the song to come through.”\nThirty years on, this is a chance for the band to reflect on its past, take a look at the present and imagine where they might go next. Playing all of the songs they’ve written seems a good way of celebrating the journey so far.

Yet few others, for whatever genius they may possess, can relate their own history to the history experienced by those who find that common bond, be it in a coming of age, living through the same realities or sharing similar experiences.\n\nEllis Paul is one of those gifted singer/songwriters.Though some may refer to him as a folksinger, he is more, for lack of a better word, a singular storyteller, a musician whose words reach out from inside and yet also express the feelings, thoughts and sensibilities that most people can relate to in one way or another, regardless of age or upbringing. The exhilaration of the open road. A ​celebration of heroes.​ ​The hope for redemption. Descriptions of those things that are both near and dear. The sharing of love..., intimate, passionate and enduring.\n\nThese are the scenarios that emerge from Ellis Paul’s new album, Chasing Beauty, a set of songs which detail, in typical Paul fashion, stories of people and places that reflect larger truths about us all. “Kick Out the Lights (Johnny Cash)” pays tribute to that fearless American icon name-checked in its title. “Plastic Soldier” offers homage to a wounded soldier returning from Afghanistan. A real-life barnstorming pilot takes the spotlight in “Jimmie Angel’s Flying Circus,” while iconic Boston blue collar musician Dennis Brennan takes the focus in “Waiting on a Break.” Even the Empire State Building and the Boston Red Sox get their due, via “Empire State” and “UK Girl (Boston Calling),” respectively.\n\nIn reality, these stories are a continuation of tales Paul has told for more than a quarter century, over the expanse of nineteen albums, numerous critical kudos (15 Boston Music Awards alone), inclusion in several movie soundtracks, and stages he’s headlined both near and far. “I’ve got a car with over 4​75​,000 miles on it, and it's my third road vehicle,​” Paul declares. “I’ve been doing 200 shows a year for over twenty years. There isn’t a town in the country where I won’t find a friend. I’m a nomad. And I’m gonna write and play until I’m gone.”\n\nNo doubt he will. Still, it’s somewhat ironic that Paul gravitated towards this bigger world of intent and expression given that the place Paul considers his hometown these days isn’t New York or Nashville, or Boston or Austin or ​Charlottesville, VA. where he lives, but rather Presque Isle, Maine, a tiny enclave surrounded by three rivers. Not surprisingly, the name translates to “almost an island.” Presque Isle shares a vanishing tradition with many small towns these days, where family farms are giving way to industrializ​ation​ ​and giant corporations, and earning a livelihood from the land is no longer the simple option it once was. Nevertheless, it’s still a haven for traditional values and for people as real and authentic as the soil they once tilled. If there’s one grace left to cling to, it’s the grace of nature’s beauty, sealed off by the surrounding mountains and fields.\n\nLikewise, his geographical origins also couldn’t have been further from the world at large. He was born in the dead of winter in the small town of Fort Kent, Maine, a place nestled right up next to the Canadian border. He came from humble origins, a family of potato farmers who could count among their forebears a veteran of the battle of Gettysburg, whose heroism on that field of honor earned him the 140 acres of Maine farmland that his descendants would continue to sow. It was the place that taught Paul the meaning of hard work and self-reliance, and the values that accompany as much drive and determination any individual could muster.\n\nAs a boy, Paul found his escape in athletics, working out as a runner and testing his mettle in the open spaces near his home. He became a star competitor, and enjoyed the advantage of traveling throughout the nation after being given opportunities to compete. Along the way, he saw more of the country than most people do in a lifetime. “I was lucky to be able to travel for competitions all over the U.S. and to see places I once could only dream of,” he recalls. “The Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles, the endless plains of Texas, the Kansas prairie, the Rocky Mountain in Wyoming. Every trip was funded by a hat the town passed around on my behalf, and it never came back empty.” When Paul finished second in a nationwide track competition, he was met at the airport by the high school marching band and a fire engine with spinning lights that drove him in triumph through town. In an expression of hometown pride, the mayor handed him the key to the city.\n\n​No one ever told Paul he had to follow in his family’s tradition. He was a dreamer after all, and he had seen enough of America to know there was more out there than his little town could ever offer. Consequently, his ambitions were never destined to stay bottled up for long. He would write, paint, play trumpet and sing in the school choir. “I never had anyone tell me I had to be a farmer,” Paul insists. “I had plenty of people telling me how my hard work and talent ​c​ould take me places​. T​hat’s enough to get you dreaming, And enough to make you believe those dreams are within reach.”\n\nIndeed, Paul found those dreams were within his reach, at least in terms of his imagination. However​ their pursuit would take him far from home. His first destination was Boston College, courtesy of a ​​track​ scholarship. Yet as Paul describes it, his athletic endeavors, combined with his academic responsibilities, served to rob him of his creativity. It was only after he suffered a knee injury which forced him to take a year off that he rebounded with a new form of expression, made possible when his girlfriend’s sister gave him a secondhand guitar. “A mysterious, lustful partnership with the instrument followed,” Paul concedes. “It became a marriage, a friendship, a lifelong bond that only comes when you find that one thing that becomes an extension of yourself. I played for hours, choosing to write ​my own original ​​songs and sing instead of studying, socializing or exploring what the Boston streets could offer after hours.”\n\nAfter graduation, Paul did find time to explore those paths, while taking opportunities to indulge his creative ambitions. Working as a teacher and social worker with inner city children by day and pursuing the possibilities offered by Boston’s fertile music scene at night, he gained prominence in local coffeehouses and open mic nights. It was the same circuit that opened the door for other like-minded artists of the day, and in turn, gave Paul exposure to such creative contemporaries as Shawn Colvin, Dar Williams, Patty Larkin, John Gorka, Catie Curtis, and Bill Morrissey. It also helped him win a Boston Underground Songwriting competition and placement on a Windham Hill Records singer/songwriter compilation, bringing him his first hint of national exposure at the same time.\n\nThe major tipping point in his career came with the opportunity to open for Bill Morrissey, one of New England’s most prominent folk artists. Paul would repeatedly ask Morrissey about his own influences and seek his advice on who he ought to listen to. “You know, that’s a very smart thing to do,” Morrissey muses. “It helped set him apart. A lot of young singers I meet are not curious about what went on before; they just say, ‘I want to sing another song about my life.’ Paul has a sense of roots, of connectedness to the whole history of folk music; he sees the thread that runs through all the generations of this music.”\n\nIt was mutual admiration that caused Paul to ask Morrissey to produce his first full album, 1993‘s Say ​Something. It was released on Black Wolf Records, the label he founded with ​Ralph​ Jaccodine, the man who would become his manager. “​Ralph was fulfilling a dream to get into the music business,” Paul recalls. “Starting with a folk singer isn’t a rocket​ launch, but we got off the ground. We started a label and began a lifelong​, DIY​ ​partnership and have been​ ​in the trenches​ for over 20 years.​”\n\nPaul also became infatuated with the music of Woody Guthrie, drawn to Woody’s social consciousness and the humanitarian streak that ran through his work. He even had a tattoo of Guthrie imprinted on his right shoulder, referring to it as “a badge of who he ​was.” His commitment to Guthrie’s legacy eventually led to his inclusion in a ten day celebration of Woody’s work held at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 1996, an event that included such notables as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, the Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco and which was presided over by Guthrie’s daughter Nora. Later, when Guthrie’s hometown of Okemah, Oklahoma hosted the first Woody Guthrie Folk Festival in July, 1998, Paul was tapped as one of the headliners. He has since made this an annual part of his touring schedule,​ garnering the honor of being named an honorary citizen of Okemah in the process. The connection with Guthrie continued into the new millennium when Nora Guthrie invited him to put music to a set of her father’s lyrics. He later participated in the “Ribbon of Highway” tour, a communal salute featuring such luminaries as Arlo Guthrie, Marty Stuart, Ramblin’ Jack Ellott, Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark and Janis Ian, among others. ​\n\nThere’s likely no greater evidence of how Guthrie’s insights and humanity have rubbed off on Paul than in this particularly telling tribute from Nora Guthrie. \"A singer songwriter is only as good as the times he reflects,”she said in praising Paul. “In times like these, when so many nuts are running the show, it's comforting to know that Ellis Paul is actually holding our sanity on his own stage! Wise, tender, brilliant and biting, Ellis is one of our best human compasses, marking in melodies and poems where we've been and where we might go if we so choose to. Personally Ellis, I'm goin' where you're goin'!​\"​\n\nWhere Paul is “goin’” is to practically every place a microphone beckons and a crowd of the folk faithful awaits. He’s become a staple at the Newport Folk Festival, ​played Carnegie hall, and venues from Alaska to Miami, Paris and London. In addition to his 19 albums released on the Rounder and Black Wolf record labels, his music has appeared on dozens of distinguished compilations. A ​Film/​DVD entitled ​3000 Miles​​ -- part concert film, part documentary, part instructional video -- provides a further prospective on both the man and his music. He’s also released a pair of children’s albums, earning him honors from the Parent’s Choice Foundation ​for both.​ ​H​is latest, ​\"​The Hero In You​\" has been turned into a​ picture book, detailing the lives of great American heroes​.​ Ellis' literate, evocative and insightful writings are further showcased in a book of poetry and short stories entitled “Notes from the Road,​\" already in it's third pressing. ​\n\nIt’s no wonder then that recently Paul received ​a ​prestigious​ honor: an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of Maine, which also asked him to ​write the school's ​a​lma ​mater a​s well as ​deliver its commencement address in May 2014.\n\nHappily, his music has been shared with a wider audience as well, through commercials, documentaries, TV shows and in the soundtracks of several blockbuster films, among them three by the Farrelly Brothers -- “Hall Pass” (starring Owen Wilson and Alyssa Milano), “Me, Myself, & Irene” (starring Jim Carrey) and “Shallow Hal” (starring Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow). Peter Farrelly summed up the sentiments of all those who have come to know and appreciate Paul’s music by referring to him as “a national treasure.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Paul’s consistently been heralded by others as well. ​O​ne writer noted “that it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music -- storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent would, out music doesn’t have to reflect our culture.\" ​Another reviewer was even more pointed. “Ellis Paul is one of the best singer/songwriters of his generation,” she commented. “And for many of us he is the face of contemporary folk music. Few are as smart, as literate, as poetic as Paul. I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene is better loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries.”\n\nIndeed, he is all that, and in a very real sense, even more. He’s an observer, a philosopher, and an astute storyteller who shares with his listeners the life lessons he’s learned, and in turn, life lessons they ought to heed as well. By affirming and defining who he is, Ellis Paul affirms and uncovers the essence of us all.\n\n-- Lee Zimmerman (writer/reviewer for American Songwriter, No Depression, New Times, Country Standard Time, Blurt, Relix, and M Music and Musicians​)​"},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Sun Seeker","date":"10 13 17","times":"\n  Doors: 10:00 pm / Show: 10:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1536079","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1536079-sun-seeker-charlotte/","desc":"Sun  Seeker  has  drawn  applause  for  their  unhurried  breed  of  Cosmic  American  Music  and  with BIDDEFORD  (Third  Man  Records),  their  long  awaited  debut  EP,  the  Nashville-based  band  more than  affirm  their  promise.  The  EP –  which  follows  Sun  Seekers  widely  acclaimed  Third  Man debut single, 2016s Georgia Dust b/w No One Knows (TMR322) – sees Alex Benick (guitar, vocals),  Asher  Horton  (bass  guitar,  vocals),  and  Ben  Parks  (drums,  vocals)  exploring  nostalgia, melancholy,  and  emotional  turmoil  via  laidback  psychedelia  pollinated  with  tight  harmonies, classic  folk  songcraft,  and  country  rock  spirit,  an  ageless  approach  that is  simultaneously archetypal and now utterly their own. Songs like With Nothing (But Our Last Words) and the yearning Wont  Keep  Me  Up  At  Night  meld  Benicks  candid  lyricism  and  stark  melodies  with creative arrangement and production technique, fashioning a sonic world to match their interior emotional scope. The bunch of musical friends at the core of Sun Seeker have been collaborating in some sense since eighth grade. The trio formed a loose collective of combos, playing together in each others bands, with Sun Seeker officially convening in January 2013. The band became fast favorites on the  Nashville  scene,  earning  word  of  mouth  and  a  fervent  fan  following  via an  electric  live presence  and  a  striking  collection  of  songs.  Sun  Seeker  will  celebrate  BIDDEFORD  with  intense national touring, not dissimilar to the approach they took in building a hometown following. The band  plan  to  use  the  time  between  runs  to  record  their  now  eagerly anticipated  debut  album, still   determined   to   keep   venturing   forward,   developing   and   expanding   the   distinctive parameters of their own intrepid sound and vision.The Speedbumps are an award-winning American band with a warm, authentic sound, built on a passion for hollow-bodied instruments, indie-folk influences, and singer-songwriter Erik Urycki’s breathy, commanding vocals and canny phrasing.\n\nThe band’s roots lie deep in the Rustbelt, where quiet strength and limited embellishment define the culture. The working class towns around Akron, the former rubber capital, from which artists like The Black Keys, Jessica Lea Mayfield, and Joseph Arthur have emerged, have provided the band with an aesthetic that seeks to tease out beauty from the gritty details of everyday life.\n\nThe band consists of Erik Urycki on vocals and guitar, Abby Luri on vocals, guitar, banjo and keys, Sam Kristoff playing cello -- often where you’d expect a guitar riff, Kevin Martinez on acoustic and electric bass, and two members on drums and percussion, Pat Hawkins and Danny Jenkins. In addition to her ethereal vocals, Luri is also a songwriter and has co-written several of the band’s tunes.\n\nThe Speedbumps have won IMA and AMA awards and performed with artists including Andrew Bird, G-Love and OKGO. Daryl Rowland, writing for the Huffington Post, said that singer Erik Urycki’s lyrics “often tackle complex human emotions with elegant economy.”\n\nWhile the band cites influences from Paul Simon to Nick Drake to Radiohead, their material and vibe have more in common with festival favorites like The Decemberists, Wilco, Ryan Adams or Mumford & Sons, with their consistently smart, spare and rootsy approach.\n\nTheir latest album, “Soil to the Seed,” was recorded in a remote cabin in the woods of Pennsylvania, where the band lived together, writing songs and laying down tracks at all hours. The resulting recording reflects that total emersion. As with seminal house-based recordings like The Band’s “Music from Big Pink,” the songs have an effortless unity.  \n\nThe Speedbumps’ unique live shows include instruments like Cello, Banjo, Ukulele, Wurlitzer, Glockenspiel, Vibraslap and Mandolin. On several occasions, the band has performed with a 40 piece symphony orchestra, featuring arrangements written by bass player, Kevin Martinez, who holds a degree in Music Theory and Composition.\n\nThe Speedbumps winning combination of thought-provoking singer-songwriter material and high-caliber musicianship have earned the band a large and loyal fan base in the Northeast and Midwest. With the May 5th release of the their new album, the band will be touring United States and abroad, sharing their new songs and soaking up the world to feed the next batch of tunes."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Mike MainsBrett Newski","date":"10 13 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1543814","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1543814-mike-mains-brett-newski-charlotte/","desc":"Mike Mains, a Detroit based musician, loves rock and roll. He also loves the creative craft of large hooks and lyrical sensibility. His earnest honesty is evident in his music, his shows, his life. Mike approaches his musical passion with lunch pal in hand, hammering out meaningful, well crafted songs like a skilled tradesman.\n\nWith two full length albums and an EP(2012’s “Home”, 2013’s “Everything” EP and 2014’s “Calm Down, Everything’s Fine”), Mike has established himself as a more than just a song writer, he’s a song “crafter”. With high octane rockers like “Miracle”(Home), “Stereo”(Home), “Take it All”(CDEF), and “Burn”(CDEF) or slower, emotional tracks like “Lady Love”(Home), “Drifter”(Home, or “Where Love Dies”(CDEF) there is plenty to choose from for music lovers alike.\n\nPerforming over 300 shows the last 3 years, Mike Mains has built a committed fan base. His shows have proven to be high energy, interactive and exciting. 2016 has seen him captivate audiences in any setting. Wanting to offer an unique, intimate view into his songs, he played his first 9 week “Living Room Tour”. This 35 date North American tour brought him into the homes and backyards of fans to perform his songs in a new context.

At age 25, he took matters into his own hands by quitting all of his part-time jobs and becoming a full-time nomad, posting up in the nooks and crannies of earth and sub-letting rooms in Vietnam, South Africa, Germany and Wisconsin to write songs and recharge between tours. Newski’s sophomore LP “Land, Air, Sea, Garage” was recorded at a surf camp in the Sri Lankan jungle, and at home in Wisconsin. The album is about diving into the world with no safety net and landing on your feet. It’s a smart indie rock n’ roll record with tongue-in-cheek moments that show parallels to Violent Femmes, Jonathan Richman, Mountain Goats, early Weezer, Frank Turner, & Elliot Smith.Two brothers are reunited after years of geographical separation by a resonant collaboration in music. Since the formation of the group in March of 2013, the Burlington, VT based indie-folk duo has honed in on their kindred synergy, living on the road while developing a large palette of material. In two and a half years, the brothers managed to play over 400 shows, covering 50,000 tour miles in support of their debut, self titled EP and first full length release, Heavy as Lead. The songs have taken them all over the country, making tour stops in the Northeast, Mid Atlantic, Mid West and South. Versatile songwriting modes, blood harmonies and fingerstyle guitar arrangements have opened doors to support a wide variety of national acts including Grace Potter, Sturgill Simpson, Bahamas, Jerry Douglas, Langhorne Slim, Blake Mills, Howie Day, The Lone Bellow, Ben Sollee, Horse Feathers and Chris Eldridge and Julian Lage.  \n**********************************************************************\n\n“Together the DuPont Brothers resonate at just the right frequency.

The lyrics are perhaps as flowery as the music, poetry the basis for the construction of the tracks and a story clouded in ambiguity unfolding with each step.”\n- Vickye, For the Country Record"},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"OLD SALT UNION","date":"11 08 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1543611","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1543611-old-salt-union-charlotte/","desc":"A great band is more than the proverbial sum of its parts, and in the pursuit of becoming something that can cut through the clutter of YouTube stars and contest show runner-ups, a great roots music band must become a way of life. Less likely to rely on production or image, they’ve got to connect with their audience only through the craftsmanship of their songs, the energy they channel on the stage and the story that brings them together.\n\nOld Salt Union is a string band founded by a horticulturist, cultivated by classically trained musicians, and fueled by a vocalist/bass player who is also a hip-hop producer with a fondness for the Four Freshmen. It is this collision of styles and musical vocabularies that informs their fresh approach to bluegrass and gives them an electric live performance vibe that seems to pull more from Vaudeville than the front porch.\n\nIn 2015 they won the FreshGrass Band contest and found the perfect collaborator in Compass Records co-founder and GRAMMY winning banjoist and composer, Alison Brown, whose attention to detail and high standards pushed the group to develop their influences from beyond a vocabulary to pull from during improvisation and into the foundation of something truly compelling in the roots music landscape.\n\nViolinist John Brighton mentions some names familiar to the Compass roster as key influences, musicians like Darol Anger, Edgar Meyer, Mike Marshall and Mark O’Connor, all of whom have collaborated with Brown in the past. Primary vocalist and bassist, Jesse Farrar (for the indie rock heads - yes, he’s related – Son Volt front man Jay Farrar is Jesse’s uncle) brings an alternative rock spirit as well as his unique formative experiences as a hip hop producer and bass player for a national tour of The Four Freshmen. The band’s self-titled Compass debut combines these instrumental proclivities with pop melodies and harmonies into a coherent piece of work that carves out a road-less-travelled for the band in the now crowded roots music genre.\n\nThe album kicks off with a nod to alternative rock sensibilities – a deconstructed symphonic drone creeps in slowly, while Farrar emerges through the atmospherics to deliver the first lines “Stranded on a lonely road/Trying to find my way back home/A dollar and a broken heart/Didn’t seem to get me very far”. His words are followed by a dramatic moment of silence (a trick often used in hip hop) that quickly launches into “Where I Stand”, a hard-driving bluegrass track that gets moving so powerfully you almost don’t notice the layer of angelic harmonies flowing consistently underneath.\n\nMandolinist Justin Wallace takes over lead vocal duties for the second track “Feel My Love” as well as a version of Paul Simon’s “You Can Call Me Al”. He pops up again on his composition “On My Way” and his no-frills, approachable voice is the perfect complement to Farrar’s more gymnastic style. The two work together beautifully on the Wallace-penned, “Hard Line”. Wallace is further showcased on the disc’s lone instrumental “Flatt Baroque”, composed by Brighton, who joins him in some twin mandolin, and it’s this more contemplative moment on the album where the listener hears him reaching to be in perfect sync with his bandmate, that best reflects Wallace’s role in the evolution story of the band. If Farrar has emerged as the heartbeat, then Wallace is the soul.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, the band was founded by banjoist Ryan Murphey, the aforementioned horticulturist who came to bluegrass music and the banjo later in life. Finding a kindred spirit in Dustin Eiskant, the band’sformer guitarist and Farrar’s cousin, the pair started the band in 2012 and Murphey played the banjo and led the band’s business through its early incarnations, including the recruitment of Farrar in 2014.\n\nWhen Eiskant quit in 2016, just as the band’s already impressive trajectory seemed to be taking a significant step forward, Murphey and the band were able to reset, adding guitarist Rob Kindle to the lineup. Kindle brings a bluegrass foundation from his early exposure to the music as a child in family settings, as well as a degree in jazz performance to the mix.\n\nThough the band had established themselves as a growing festival act with performances at LouFest, Stagecoach Festival, Bluegrass Underground, Winter Wondergrass, Freshgrass, Wakarusa, Yonder Mountain String Band's Harvest Festival, and the 2014 Daytona 500, it was their breakout track on Spotify, “Madam Plum” that seemed to amplify awareness of the band beyond the bluegrass bubble.\n\nOf working with the band in the studio, producer Brown says, “These post modern bluegrassers are true renegades. While they look like a bluegrass band, their musical sensibilities run much deeper and broader, borrowing as much from indie rock and jazz fusion as from Bill Monroe. And, even more exciting to me, they know no fear! They are wide open musical adventurers and we had a great time experimenting in the studio at the crossroads of these disparate influences.”\n\nThe most unexpected but possibly most fascinating song on the album is a ballad entitled “Bought and Sold”. Its earnest beauty is balanced with a youthful inventiveness that leaves a solemn mark on the listener who might wake up at the end of it thinking, “What just happened?”.\n\nAt this point, the future of the band seems marvelously unclear. The album closes with “Here and Off My Mind” which seems like the bluegrass song that Conor Oberst never wrote featuring a lyric that ends with the promise of “a better life” though from the all-hands-on-deck jam session that breaks out in the middle (is that a kazoo?) one gets the sense that the band can’t imagine a better one than they have in the beat up Winnebago they currently call home.\n\nOld Salt Union’s self-titled new album will be released August 4th."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"The \"All Strung Up\" Tour...Daniel Champagne, Hussy Hicks, Christie Lenee","date":"10 19 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1542912","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1542912-all-strung-up-tour-daniel-charlotte/","desc":"One reviewer recently wrote – ‘Daniel Champagne exudes a natural ease on stage, as he sings poignant lyrics and beautifully crafted melodies that invariably whisk the heart up with grand romanticism.

Wicklund’s signature curls flying through the air transport back to the time of the first female rock star, Janis Joplin. Capturing the old soul of a new generation, Wicklund’s singing voice and guitar playing have earned her comparisons to blues/soul musician Susan Tedeschi.\n\nWith the band’s musical influences from Jimi Hendrix, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers and Jeff Beck, Wicklund’s classic rock look get fans listening, but her guitar skills keep them wanting more.\n“I remember the first time I saw Nirvana in 1990 in a small club in Jax Beach with a handful of long hairs and shoe gazers. I will never forget that night, but I was more blown away tonight by Hannah than by Kurt. She is a monster talent and her trio is cool as shit. Tonight was one of those once in a life time moments when you catch a superstar on the way up. Please support her so everyone else who plays guitar can retire,” said Josh Talbot, Nashville native.\n\nWhile touring and playing private events including parties for AC/DC’s Brian Johnson, the band has managed to release four albums. The latest, a self-titled album recorded at Echo Mountain Recording Studios in Asheville, NC in 2015.

He's a musical omnivore, devouring every popular music sound of the last 70 years, and mixing 'em all together seamlessly into his own stew. Yet, the one thing that most people notice about Patrick isn't his ability to copy - it's his authenticity. Like his heroes, artists like Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, Doug Sahm, Joe Tex, Patrick somehow manages to blend all of these influences into something all his own. \n\nIt's no wonder that as a kid he immersed himself in his dad's extensive record collection: 60s folk, vintage country, soul, and, of course, blues. Patrick spent hours teaching himself to fingerpick along to Leadbelly, Lightnin' Hopkins, and other folk-blues giants. \n\nIn his late teens, Patrick began playing the clubs and coffeehouses around Kent, OH. He quickly gained a reputation for the intricate country blues style he was developing: part Piedmont picking, part Delta slide - with an equally impressive deep, smooth vocal style. \n\nBut Patrick wouldn't stay in the acoustic world for long. His love of 50s era soul and rock fused with the adrenaline-soaked garage punk revival happening throughout the Rust Belt pushed him to form a band. \n\nAfter 6 critically acclaimed records (two produced by longtime collaborator Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys), Patrick has expanded his touring radius to 49 states and Europe. He's played premiere festivals (Newport Folk Fest, Merlefest, Montreal Jazz Fest, Telluride Blues & Brews) and supported international acts such as The Black Keys, The Tedeschi Trucks Band, The Wood Brothers, Hot Tuna, and others on tour. \n\nHis latest record, Daytime Turned To Nighttime, comes out in September 2015. It was recorded in his adopted community of E. Nasheville, TN and features contributions from long-time collaborator and producer Joe McMahan (Allsion Moorer, Webb Wilder), Ron Eoff (Cate Brothers, Levon Helm), Bryan Owings (Tony Joe White, Solomon Burke), among others. For Daytime Sweany took a fairly different approach than his usual raw, intense blues sound, opting for more subtle textures and playing. Seminal 70s records by Bill Withers, Bobbie Gentry and Bobby Charles & The Band provide the sonic blueprint, while Sweany wraps his trademark baritone and impeccable acoustic slide work around songs of longing, redemption and growing up."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Malcolm Holcombe","date":"11 29 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1526138","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1526138-malcolm-holcombe-charlotte/","desc":"Acclaimed singer-songwriter, Malcolm Holcombe, whose \"heartfelt baritone\" (NPR) delivers \"haunted country, acoustic blues, and rugged folk\" (Rolling Stone), released his 14th studio album, Another Black Hole, on February 12, 2016.\n\nProduced by Grammy winning producer and engineer, Ray Kennedy, and Brian Brinkerhoff, Another Black Hole features Holcombe's rasping vocals and bright, percussive guitar accentuating his insightful lyrics. \"It is Malcolm's perception of the world that make his songs hit you like a gunpowder blast.

As the revival of music in the 60’s and 70’s brought together the heritage of the Great American songbook, the flair of jazz and heartache of the Delta blues, Angelo integrates these forms into his own music with great ease and delight. For the past decade, Angelo has captivated audiences across the country with his high-spirited live show and captured the imagination of a loyal following through prolific songwriting, independently selling over 40,000 albums along the way.\n      Angelo’s latest full-length album A Matter of Time (Aug 2017) reflects his journey through the life-altering experiences of becoming a father and facing his daughter’s rare, life-threatening metabolic disease. His daughter received a liver transplant in Fall 2016, and Angelo’s latest release A Matter of Time wrestles with the aches of adversity and ultimately celebrates the beauty of life and the hope he has for his daughter. A Matter of Time embraces the soul, classic r&b and piano-pop of some of Angelo’s more prominent influences -- Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Elton John -- while fearlessly venturing into new sonic territory to compete with pop contemporaries like Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake. Alongside his finest songwriting to date, Angelo’s voice resounds as an irrefutable force as he carries listeners to new places unfamiliar to the likes of modern pop music.Matt Simons BioEven before a record label or traditional backing, Matt Simons had already been heard around the globe. After being noticed from a Facebook ad he created for his independent album Pieces, the song “With You” received a high-profile 2013 placement on one of the biggest Dutch soap operas. Before the Northern California-born and Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter knew it, he began selling out shows in Europe and was serving as guest judge on the Netherlands X-Factor, while “With You” went platinum in Holland and earned the unofficial title of the country’ s “most played funeral song.”“As strange as it may sound, that was the ultimate compliment,” he says. “My music was being used to celebrate legacies. The fact that people could be that affected by a song I wrote was incredible to me. I didn’ t know that’ s what I loved about writing so much, but I learned it.”He can speak to any occasion though, and that’ s why his 2015 single “Catch & Release” and its (Deepend Remix) became a runaway international smash. Cumulatively, the song amassed over 150 million-plus Spotify streams and counting in less than a year’ s time, and the remixed version soared to #1 on HypeMachine twice. Stateside, it went Top 5 at AAA radio and soundtracked a tourism ad for the state of Arizona, whileBillboard pegged it as one of “Tomorrow’ s Hits.” He made his North American television debut on NBC’ s Today Show, performing the song. Globally, it clinched #1 in 7 countries including France, Germany, Belgium, and Spain, reaching platinum in Germany, Belgium, Holland & Switzerland, and gold certifications in Italy and Sweden. Sold out tours followed as well as festival appearances at Pinkpop, Frequency, and many more. A marriage between styles, “Catch & Release” lithely balances a deep house soundscape with finger-picked acoustic guitars and his soulful crooning. “’ Catch & Release’  is about the common shared struggle of the grind and how everyone’ s got their own way of dealing with it,” he explains. “Some people will go for a run, or others will have a drink, etc. It’ s whatever your way of releasing all the tension you build over the course of any given day. We wanted to do something different with the remix. The dance community seems hungry for songs with a deeper meaning. It felt really natural.”“Catch & Release” paved the way for his 2016 EP, When The Lights Go Down [[PIAS] Recordings]. Building off that hybrid of tropical house charm and acoustic soul, he crafted the collection’ s five tracks at various spots across the world, while touring behind “Catch & Release.”Matt cut the first single “Lose Control” during a stop in London with producer Steve Mac [James Blunt, Kelly Clarkson, Leona Lewis]. He delicately expands his sound once more with sunny production and another undeniable refrain. Next to Steve, Matt worked again with his friends Bob and Falco of Deepend on the track, who added additional production. “Whereas ‘ Catch & Release’  is about self-introspection and self-awareness, ‘ Lose Control’  is about letting your inhibitions go and connecting with another person,” he reveals. “It’ s in that tropical house lane, but it takes another step forward.  The EP is a little bit of everything.”The EP title When The Lights Go Down speaks to his knack for lyrical storytelling. Throughout the new music, he perfects that penchant for a captivating tale.\n“I like to write based off of a concept,” he says. “There’ s a narrative at the heart of When The Lights Go Down. When you’ re going through a breakup, everything could feel fine during the day, but once it turns nighttime and it’ s time go to sleep, you really start missing somebody.”It’ s no surprise he’ s been honing his chops since childhood. For Matt, music’ s a family tradition as both of his grandparents were professional opera singers, and his dad shared a love for The Beatles and the classics with him early on. Playing saxophone his whole life, he got a degree in Jazz Saxophone Performance at The Purchase College Conservatory. That background ultimately gave him the foundation to write these kinds of songs.“I won’ t ever lose that influence,” he leaves off. “I started off with jazz and those rhythms and patterns have been ingrained in me. Now, my main focus is to continue writing these songs that really can resonate.”"},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Eliot Bronson Album Release Show!","date":"09 01 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1530546","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1530546-eliot-bronson-album-release-charlotte/","desc":"Picture a street in working-class Baltimore some 30 years ago. Kids play in the shadows of the row houses that line the sidewalks. Their parents sit on the stoops leading up to front doors. It all seems normal at first glance. \n\nBut zoom in on one of these homes — that old duplex built back when this part of town was still mainly open fields. Inside is a completely different community, where fundamentalism, hippie values and volatile, unpredictable emotions coexist and collide. Escape is difficult: the only way out is to pass through the bedrooms of people you might be trying to get away from.\n\nThis is where Eliot Bronson grew up. Yeah, he often wanted to slip away from there, but the first thing he saw once he exited was the Pentecostal Church across the street where his father and grandfather had preached and where congregants spoke in tongues.\n\nSo Eliot looked inward instead.\n\n“For better or worse, I’ve always been a weirdo,” he remembers. “I was reading about Zen Buddhism when all my friends were getting high and drunk in high school.\n\n“Of course,” he adds, “I did all that stuff later.”\n\nHe also observed. In this kaleidoscopic family, where glossolalia and, on occasion, alcohol-fueled ravings, sometimes bled into each other, Bronson found shelter in music. At age 15, he got his first guitar and started teaching himself to play. “Right away, I wanted to write my own songs,” he says. “My house was pretty chaotic, crazy, and unhealthy, so I took to music like it was a life raft. It was something I could do to keep myself alive.”\n\nPunk rock was his shelter at first. Then one day his dad put on a few of his favorite LPs — Bob Dylan’s The Times They Are A-Changin’, something by Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Eliot had heard these albums a thousand times before. This time, though…\n\n“… it resonated with me,” Eliot says.  “It wasn’t just in the background. I tuned into it for the first time. There was a magic and a power there. It didn’t talk down to the listener but it was also high art. It asked you to be smart and to become a better version of yourself. For me, this was a moment when it became my music, not just my parents’ music.”\n\nFrom local coffee houses and venues beyond Baltimore, Bronson sharpened his writing and performance. He cultivated a working approach that involved singing to himself as ideas came to him and never jotting down chord changes or lyrics once he had committed the finished version to memory. A local following grew. Astute observers saw something different in the young artist’s work. The Baltimore Sun even anointed him “a folk singing wunderkind.”\n\nExpanding his range, Bronson toured as one-half of a duo. They moved to Atlanta and picked up a gig in a room frequented by The Indigo Girls, John Mayer, Shawn Mullins and other discerning clientele. When his partner quit to take a sensible non-musical job, Bronson persisted on his own. His songs won first-place honors at MerleFest’s Chris Austin Songwriting Contest and Eddie Owens Presents “Songwriter Shootout.”  He issued several solo albums, including a self-titled release in 2014 that prompted Glide Magazine to describe him as “a gorgeous, magnificent hybrid of (Ryan) Adams, Jason Isbell and Jim James.” Bop n Jazz upped that ante by heralding him as “maybe the best singer/songwriter since Dylan.”\n\nWriters may have trouble topping these accolades, though that’s what Bronson’s latest album merits. Scheduled to release Aug. 25 on Rock Ridge Music, James offers songs that are more like pictures than movies, capturing moments and digging deeply into their meanings. A stomping beat, raw harmonica and searing electric slide drives the opening track, “Breakdown In G Major,” followed by a selection of songs that only confirm Bronson’s restless, escalating excellence.\n\n“Good Enough,” for example, captures a relationship in its final stage — a stage that may end tomorrow or stretch on for years. Bronson sings it sorrowfully, asking the rhetorical question of whether “‘good enough’ is good enough for you” from this point. “When I stumbled onto that line, I was like, ‘That’ll probably stick,’” he says. “But I think the song really came from the first line, ‘Were we really that young?’ Sometimes it takes just one line to resonate with me and get me to start writing.”\n\nThen there’s “The Mountain,” whose elusive grandeur delivers a powerful message but leaves it to the listener to parse its meaning. “There’s a very literalist current in writing and music right now,” Bronson observes. “There aren’t a lot of layers to lyrics these days. It’s just what you see on the page. So when you don’t write that way, you get, ‘What are you hiding?’”\n\nHe laughs and then concludes, “I don’t look at it that way. For me, it’s more about how you feel when you hear it. What does it do for you? That’s the message!”\n\nOne more, “Rough Ride,” is a departure for Bronson. Here, the meaning is clear: When 25-year-old Freddie Gray fell unaccountably into a coma in the back of a Baltimore police van, much of America expressed shock and outrage. So did Bronson, but he channeled those emotions into this song.\n\n“I had mixed feelings about writing this because I don’t like inserting my political or social beliefs into art,” he explains. “Art should be about connecting people, not drawing lines between them. But I was listening to Dylan’s Desire album at the time, especially ‘Hurricane.’ I always wanted to write a song like that. It was like, ‘How can you tell a story almost journalistically with great emotional impact and yet not come off heavy-handed?’ I wanted to see if I could do it. Now I’m glad I did.”\n\nKnown for his empathetic work with Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and other utterly original artists, producer Dave Cobb played a critical role in bringing James to fruition. “His honesty and old-fashioned vibe were so appealing to me,” Bronson says. “They leant themselves to the way I created. And, of course, it was a huge boost to have this great artist/producer at your back.” \n\nThey had worked together previously on his 2014 release, Eliot Bronson. “But this album is different,” Bronson points out. “It’s more sparse and economical. My voice is stronger. And I think it’s a step away from the purely Americana vibe of the last one in a direction that I have a hard time defining. I’m excited to discover how this music will define itself.”\n\nWherever he’s bound, Bronson promises to write and sing the truth as he sees and feels it. “For the really great artists, like Dylan or Paul Simon, you never quite find what you’re looking for,” he says. “As you get closer, it changes. It stays elusive. What I want to do now isn’t the same as what I wanted to do five years ago. And that’s what keeps me going.” And it’s that shift that drives Bronson to continue to refine his art.Through his full band vehicle, Time Sawyer, Sam Tayloe is interested in “real people and real songs” and that’s just what the listener finds in his music – a sense of realness. Blending a grassroots feel with heart-felt lyrics, Tayloe pulls the listener in with introspective ballads that land in that rootsy sweet spot where folk, alt-country, and rock gather for a good time.\n\nFor Sam, time is a muse for songwriting; it’s the thread that runs through life, bringing new experiences and giving us a sense of urgency, while still connecting us with our past. He has performed either solo or with Time Sawyer on the stages of some of the Southeast’s most iconic festivals, including Merlefest, Floydfest, Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion, Rhythm n’ Blooms, Carolina in the Fall and IBMA’s Bluegrass First Class sharing bills with the likes of Langhorne Slim, Phil Cook, Steep Canyon Rangers, The Wood Brothers, Joe Pug, Holy Ghost Tent Revival, and many more.\n\nFrom Tayloe come memorable lyrics and strong melodies that result in songs that will stay in your head long after the music stops. Sam continues to develop a loyal and growing fan base. Whether playing in an intimate listening room or a large outdoor festival, the goal is to forge a face-to-face connection with the audience so that all become friends who happen to be fans. He's definitely our friend and you should be his."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"THE WILD REEDS","date":"08 18 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1494591","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1494591-wild-reeds-charlotte/","desc":"The Wild Reeds' sound is highlighted by the interweaving vocal harmonies of three phenomenally talented front-women - Kinsey Lee, Sharon Silva and Mackenzie Howe - who swap lead vocal duties and shuffle between an array of acoustic and electric instruments throughout the set. They are backed by a rhythm section of Nick Jones (drums) and Nick Phakpiseth (bass).\n\nEach with their own style, The Wild Reeds' three songwriters make music that is dynamic and unpredictable. They write lyrics and melodies with the thoughtfulness of seasoned folk artists, and perform with the reckless enthusiasm of a young punk band in a garage. Warm acoustic songs and harmonium pump organ seamlessly give way to fuzzed-out shredding and guitar distortion.\n\nWith the upcoming release of 'The World We Built' on April 7, the Los Angeles-based quintet continues a national breakthrough that has been rapidly growing since the release of their EP 'Best Wishes' this summer. NPR Music critic Bob Boilen championed the band, saying \"great singers aren't easy to come by, so finding three in one band is something special.\" The New York Times praised their live show, saying \"the communal experience was amazing,\" while KCRW (Los Angeles) called them \"top-notch vocalists.\"\n\nThe first single from the new album, \"Only Songs,\" is catching the attention of radio programmers around the country, like John Richards of KEXP (Seattle), who after listening to the track declared, \"we just decided this is the best song ever.\"\n\n\"Only Songs\" was written by Howe, and highlights her rock-centric approach, inspired by the '60s and '70s rock songs her mother raised her on. \"It's about the feeling that music gives you,\" she told NPR in an interview. \"There's a freedom in music found nowhere else and it doesn't discriminate, it's in the garage and the cathedral.\"\n\nLee penned the second song on the album, \"Fall To Sleep,\" a lament to her own mental health under the strains of both a nine-to-five job and the extremes of a touring musician's life. True to her roots in folk music, it begins on a soft note, as a dreamy acoustic ballad, before taking a slightly darker turn, breaking into distorted guitar parts and a Pixies-esque chorus.\n\nSilva's contemplative, complex lyrical approach is best represented on the anthemic standout track \"Capable.\" When asked to describe her songwriting style, she explains, \"lately, my songs have been like stories with high highs and low lows - sort of like yelling at someone and then whispering an apology.\"\n\nDespite their distinct viewpoints, each songwriter complements the next, with each song building on the anticipation created by the last. \"What brings us together is the three part vocal harmony,\" says Howe. \"When we're all singing together, it really becomes one unique voice.\"\nThe band takes a humble approach to their recent success. \"I think that when you write earnestly and honestly, people will relate,\" says Silva. \"But there are lots of bands who do that and don't receive any attention, so I think any success we've had must just be pure luck.\"\nWhen watching them perform live, it quickly becomes obvious that luck has nothing to do with it. Each of The Wild Reeds is more than talented enough to front their own band, but when all three are singing at once in harmony, their music reaches its emotional apex.\n\n\"I don't think that we have figured out how to detach from our emotions yet. We take it all on stage. The voice is such a personal and vulnerable instrument,\" says Lee. \"We aren't as concerned with sounding 'pretty' as we are with sounding real. Everything we do is very raw and I think that's why people tend to find comradery in our lyrics.\"\nRecreating that feeling in a studio environment is an ambitious task. Recorded by producer Peter Katis (The National, Interpol, Local Natives) at Tarquin Studios in Connecticut, 'The World We Built' captures it perfectly, and elevates their sound to a whole new level.\n\"Our sound has evolved as we have evolved as people. We've grown to love a lot of records on the road, sharing music with each other during the hours we spend in the van, which has broadened and united our taste,\" says Howe. \"We've also grown as musicians and it's allowed us to explore new instruments and sounds. This new record is a much more accurate depiction of what we sound like live. It's got more punch and depth.\"\n\nAlong with musical growth, the content of their songwriting has changed with the band's life experiences since they started out. \"The songs on the album were written over the last three years, and it's apparent that we are more empowered now as women,\" says Howe. \"The title 'The World We Built' refers to the social constructs we've had to face during the last three years touring as a female fronted band. A lot of these songs illustrate our disillusionment with the myths we've been taught in a patriarchal society, and how we've experienced them in different aspects of our lives - love, success, self esteem, etc.\"\n\"As we got older and started to witness the world from a different perspective, we started to write about human issues in a different light,\" explains Lee. \"It's so easy to write about love when you're young because that's the only thing you have to worry about. Now we have a lot of other things in life to occupy our thoughts and songwriting, like experiencing the struggle and exhaustion from following your dream, coming of age, and doubt.\"\n\n\"Releasing music and touring the country have been amazing and eye-opening experiences,\" says Silva. \"I'm still majorly pumped and grateful that I get to play music for people every day.\"\n\nThat optimism resonates with audiences. When they perform live, their passion is infectious. They look like artists living out their dream on stage - the kind of band you idolized as a kid, and as an adult, the kind of band that reminds you why you loved music in the first place.\n\n\"Our live show has been how we've gained most of our fans. We've learned that people are just looking for authenticity.

Rather than scrap the trip, the affable North Carolina born and raised songwriter/Americana icon conferred with steel player/producer/friend Tommy Detamore and drummer/longtime friend Tom Lewis– and realized all his Texas bandmates were available.\n\n“I thought it might be now or never,” laughs the prolific Lauderdale, who’s collaborated with Dr. Ralph Stanley, Buddy Miller, Buddy Miller, Elvis Costello, Robert Hunter, Donna the Buffalo, Rodney Crowell and the North Mississippi All Stars. “They’d been saying you need to come down here and make a record, but other things kept coming up. Suddenly, my schedule was open – and that’s right where I was supposed to be.”\n\nIt’s been a few years since Lauderdale focused on the hard stuff of North Hollywood’s Palomino Club – after sojourns into bluegrass, Southern soul, jam band bursts, lean rock and yes, Americana. Divine intervention or not, This Changes Everything shows Lauderdale as one of the dynamic forces who’s shaped the last thirty years of modern country – including 14 George Strait cuts (“Where The Sidewalk Ends,” “Don’t Make Me Come Over There,” “We Shouldn’t Be Doing This,” which appears here), a Patty Loveless/George Jones CMA Awards winner (“You Don’t Seem To Miss Me”), a Mark Chesnutt chart-topper (“Gotta Get A Life”) and a Dixie Chicks raver (“Hole In My Head”). – as well as this thing they call “Americana.” \n\nWorking with sometime Steve Earle & the Dukes and fulltime Masterson guitar Chris Masterson and Cory Morrow vet John Carroll on guitars, Asleep at the Wheel cornerstone Floyd Domino on piano, Willie Nelson & Family’s Kevin Smith on bass, Heybale and Whitney Rose regular Tom Lewis on drums and fiddle from Western Swing Hall of Famer/solo artist Bobby Flores and Faron Young to Lee Ann Womack regular Hank Singer, producer Detamore took almost a dozen songs and created a template for the kind of honest to God country people who know the difference from the first swinging note of “This Changes Everything.”\n\n“The classic country style was something I really wanted to return to,” explains Lauderdale. “I felt a calling for it, and these songs felt right. It’s something a band could be playing when you went to a Texas dance hall like Gruene Hall, the Continental Club, or any country bar in the world. You could hear it playing on the jukebox, or the band. And it’s not something you hear a lot of these days.\n\n“George Jones, Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash, Johnny Bush, Ray Price,” continues Lauderdale, ticking off his foundation. “Emmylou, Loretta Lynn, Tammy… You know, steel guitar, Telecaster, fiddle. That era and those themes, to me, are what country music is.\n\n“And in 2017, it can’t be just that one thing – the same way rock & roll isn’t just Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Little Richard. But those touchstones can still work. When you look at George Strait, he’s carried a lot of it forward. And for me, if you’re fluid when you’re playing it, the songs don’t have to be retro sounding, but hopefully transcend time.”\n\nBeyond the Lauderdale cut by George Strait “We Really Shouldn’t Be Doing This” and the Derailers’ ironic “All The Rage In Paris,” also covered by the Randy Rogers Band with Johnny Bush, the songs on This Changes Everything have never been heard before.\n\n“This records got four shuffles,” Lauderdale marvels. “Frank Dycus and I wrote ‘It All Started and Ended With You’ and ‘I’ll Still Be Around,’ as well as the title track with Bruce Robison and one I wrote with Odie Blackmon ‘Lost In The Shuffle.’ Plus Terry McBride and I wrote a Western swing thing ‘You Turn Me Around’ back in ’92, and I’ve always wanted to record it.”\n\nGiven that Lauderdale has moved through the bluegrass scene of the Carolinas, onto the New York City scene where he met Buddy Miller and Shawn Colin, then out to California where he fell in with the post-cowpunk Palomino crowd that included Dwight Yoakam, Lucinda Williams, Dave Alvin, Chris Gaffney and Rosie Flores, he’s lived his music through and through, Whether it’s the lost in the movement “Drive,” which opens co-writer Hayes Carll’s latest and closes Everything, the wildly romantic “The Weakness of Two Hearts,” or the promise “I’ll Still Be Around,” Lauderdale demonstrates his hardcore honky tonk chops tempered with the verve of unfettered Saturday night..\n\n“I made an album in ’88 with Pete Anderson for CBS that never came out – and I didn’t know if it was too country for the time,” Lauderdale admits. “I remember Pete saying, ‘The way I see it you have two paths: a Bakersfield Buck Owens with a little John Fogerty thrown in, or a newer Creedence Clearwater (Revival) with a little Buck thrown in. I’ve always thought about that, the idea of bringing the one through the Bakersfield.”\n\nIf that record never saw the light of day, the Rodney Crowell/John Leventhal-produced Planet of Love cemented Lauderdale’s reputation as a post modern traditionalist. Though it failed to deliver him stardom of his own, eight of the ten songs ended up being recorded by others, including “Where The Sidewalk Ends” and “The King of Broken Hearts” for the Pure Country soundtrack by George Strait, will present the versatile artist with the 2016 Americana Music Association’s WagonMaster Award for his role in shaping the genre.\n\n“A lot of times through the early days, I’d do solo gigs – and I’d take my banjo, my guitar dobro, and harmonica and play Hank Williams, George Jones, Gram Parsons and Ralph Stanley. It was country, bluegrass, blues and soul music, really… and it all fit together.\n\n“I think when you do something straight up, those things bleed through in ways that really charge the music. It’s why I love Tommy and this band so much: they have such varied experiences, but they’re all guarded in the old school country. So they could make a record that was straight up country, but had the fire of those other elements.”\n\nWhile he wears a Manuel suit like nobody else, has manners that would make his preacher daddy proud, writes with a dexterity that accommodates Donna the Buffalo, Dr. Ralph Stanley, Patty Loveless and George Jones and sings like he’s sliding into one of those bespoke jackets, Jim Lauderdale is a relentlessly restless creative. If he’s not plotting the next record, he’s writing with someone by email or anchoring a festival, be it bluegrass, jam band, Americana or progressive country.\n\n“When I was on a major label, I got grief that I was all over the place. Now I’m on my own, and it lets me do whatever I feel. That’s Americana – bluegrass, rock, soul and blues, and even something pure country like this.”"},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Happy Labor Day","date":"09 04 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 8:00 pm ","ticketfly":"1536358","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1536358-happy-labor-day-charlotte/","desc":"The Muse Crew wishes everyone a safe and happy Labor Day holiday!!!

Singing in a barbed lilt full of deep worry and gritty determination in equal measure, she conveys emotions too finely shaded to be easily named, yet will be familiar to any listener who’s had their heart broken—or has broken a heart.\n\nThis is, in other words, not a well-behaved singer-songwriter album. Instead, it’s feisty and rough-around-the-edges, full of humor and bite and attitude from a woman who proclaims, “I’d rather throw a punch than bat my eye.” Royal Blue hints at autobiography without sounding self-absorbed, as Lilly transforms a rough patch of life into smart, sturdy, sometimes even hilarious songs that don’t sit squarely in any one genre. Instead, Royal Blue reaches out boldly and playfully into many different sounds and styles: Austin folk rock, Pacific Northwest indie, pre-Oasis Britpop, New York punk ca. 1977. There are ‘90s alt guitars and ’00 indie synths, some twang and some Neko Case and Kim Deal.\n\nSetting the tone for the album, “Far Away” marries a shimmery Cure synth theme to a steady rock-and-roll backbeat, as Lilly explains the devastating realities of a love gone sour: “I have never felt more far away than when you were right here.” When she delivers a volley of ooo-ooo-ooohs on the coda, it’s hard to tell whether she’s lamenting her loss or proclaiming her freedom. Even at its most personal, Royal Blue remains complicated and often contradictory. The surging surf-country number “Machine” hints at rebellious adolescence while “Somebody’s Daughter” is a nod to Lilly’s songwriting father, John Hiatt.\nLilly’s songs are equal parts romantic autopsy and acid kiss-off to a dismissive lover. He shows up again on the fidgety “Get This Right,” with its insistent drum patter, churning guitars, and anthemic chorus. “When you turn your lamp off, please hear my sweet, soft voice,” Lilly sings over the gentle acoustic strums and Doppler-effect synths on “Your Choice.” Then she adds, with startling finality, “You made your choice.” Royal Blue is not your typical break-up album, though. Lilly would rather rock than mope.\n\nTo say she comes by it naturally shouldn’t imply that it’s all easy for her. Her father is a famously eclectic singer-songwriter whose tunes have been covered by Emmylou Harris, Nick Lowe, Willie Nelson, and Bob Dylan, among others. Living just outside of Nashville, he provides gentle counsel and sage advice to his daughter. “I’d be a fool not to take it,” she says. “We have a really good relationship, and there’s a lot of trust there, so I feel comfortable talking to him about certain songwriting predicaments. I played him some songs I was trying to write, and he said, these are really good, but it sounds like you’re trying to do something different. You don’t have to come up with special chords or anything. Why don’t you just be you? That was simple advice, but good advice.”\n\nLilly being herself means playing songs that are sharply witty, brutally frank, and musically adventurous. In that regard, her backing band has proved crucial in helping her realize her full potential as a songwriter and performer. The group has been playing and touring with her for years, and they played on her 2012 debut, Let Down. “We’re tougher now with a new confidence in our playing,” she says of the band, which includes Beth Finney on lead guitar, Jake Bradley on bass, Luke Schneider on pedal steel guitar and Jon Radford on drums.\n\nIt helps that they all share a love of ‘90s alt-rock bands, which comes through in the distressed guitars, the urgent backbeats, and the post-punk synths. Lilly cites the Pixies and the Breeders as influences on this record, as well as Dinosaur Jr. and—her all-time faves—Pearl Jam. The group recorded these dozen songs at Playground Sound, a small studio located in producer Adam Landry’s backyard in Nashville.\n\n“I know Adam and am a fan of his work,” Lilly says. “I also knew he did analog recording, which excited me. I wanted to try that.” She chose Landry because he was a versatile rock producer who has worked with Deer Tick, T. Hardy Morris of Dead Confederate, and Hollis Brown. “Sometimes I think it might be easy to take my songs to Twang Town, if someone wanted to, but they’re not country songs. I had a feeling Adam would bring out other things in the music. Which is exactly what he did.”\n\nIn the studio, Adam credits Lilly with being game for anything: “She would be playing electric guitar with her band, and I’d be in the control room running the tape machine. I had an old KORG polysynth plugged into a Memory Man. I reached over and started playing it, and she didn’t miss a beat. She’d just go with it. She trusted me and was open-minded, and I think that helped create that sort of late ‘80s/early ‘90s vibe on the record.” But it all comes down to the songs themselves. “A killer backing track and a killer vocal can be totally ruined by really stupid lyrics,” says Adam, who was drawn to the stark candor of Lilly’s songwriting. “She’s just real honest. That’s the big thing here.”\n\n“That’s the only way I know how to write as of now,” she admits. “Maybe that will change, because writing always does, and maybe I’ll learn to take myself out of it a little more and embellish the details. But right now I don’t know any other way. I hope people don’t think, wow, she really has some issues. But you know what? If they do, that’s fine, too. I have a hard time saying a lot of things in life, so it’s easier to do it through the song. It’s a healthy coping process for me.”\"New York songwriter Brian Dunne may have graduated from the Berklee College of Music, but his schooling is firmly grounded in Hank Williams, Neil Young, and Ryan Adams.

Tony Eltora was born in Jessup Pennsylvania to a rather normal middle class Italian/Polish family before eventually moving to a suburb outside of Richmond, VA at the age of 10. As a young boy Eltora was what he would like to call a “creative introvert” spending most of his time with his head in the clouds. Shortly after moving to VA, a friend from the neighborhood was starting a band and needed a guitarist, so Tony persuaded his mother to go down to the local music/jewelry/Christian nicknack/I’ll sell anything to make a dollar store and buy him a guitar. From that point on, the guitar never left his side. Music was the perfect vehicle for Eltora to express himself creatively and emotionally.\n\nInfluenced by blues, rock and jazz music, Tony began writing and performing with local bands at clubs and festivals in the Richmond area. Known for his raw soulful playing and smooth guitar tone, Tony slowly began turning heads as people started to take notice of his talents. Wanting to further his knowledge of music, Tony left the small town life and moved to the city where he began going to school for music.\n\nWhile living in Richmond, he started to fall prey to city lifestyles that you find in dark alley’s and began a downward spiral that landed him broke, dropping out of school and disenfranchised with playing music. Watching friends and family struggle with addiction and alcoholism and slowly becoming a statistic himself, he found himself virtually homeless. Later that year a chance opportunity to go to Africa came from a friend and Eltora decided to go. His life would suddenly take a drastic turn and Tony would make a move to Lenoir, NC. While in NC, Eltora began working as a counselor with troubled youth and rediscovering the joy’s of writing and playing music again. He would once again start playing and touring with a few local and regional bands and start teaching private music lessons at a local music store. Because of his love of teaching kids and believing in the therapeutic power of music, Tony helped found the Hickory Music Factory in 2012, a non profit organization in Hickory, NC with the mission to build futures through music by teaching, performance and community outreach.\n\nEltora has shared the stage with many national and regional musicians including, Tim Reynolds, Sam Bush, Keller Williams, George Porter Jr, Oteil Burbridge, and Acoustic Syndicate, to name a few. His debut CD “Between Love and Tragedy” showcases Eltora’s guitar playing along with his insightful and thought provoking lyrics. Telling stories of love, loss and rebirth, the CD highlights the influence that blues, jazz and world music has had on him.Yes Ma'am - A country-folk group based in Charlotte, NC.  2 Guitars, tight harmonies and a hammer dulcimer.

With face-melting guitar licks, hard-hitting drum beats and soulful vocals, this motley crew has found their home in Austin, Texas. Kapsner, Rush and Jekot started their collective musical journey at the young age of 13. The trio was dispersed across Texas before reconnecting as a group in the Live Music Capitol of the World. There they stumbled upon Durand, a seasoned percussionist with eighteen years of experience. After a jam session at SXSW, the four never looked back – and The Mammoths were born. \n\n\"The Mammoths are an up-and-coming Austin band to watch fueled by their fiery unapologetic live shows reminiscent of a young Led Zeppelin. In meeting with these guys at AMF on their future plans, this band is clearly driven on playing hard and using the old school work ethic of making fans one sweaty show at a time.” - Alex Vallejo (Vallejo Music Group/Austin Music Foundation).\n\n\"Crisp and catchy songwriting and performances make The Mammoths new recordings jump through the speakers.\" - Kevin Wommack (Playing in Traffic Records)There is no hiding that each member of The High Divers hails from South Carolina. A subtle twang dots the roots rock n’ roll\nlandscape from which the band pulls its sound and feel. “Riverlust”, the group’s debut album, is full of southern tinged\nimagery that places you in the deep woods of South Carolina. It becomes clear after just a few verses that The High Divers,\nthough mining a vein uniquely their own, have a hard time getting the sounds from Laurel Canyon, Muscle Shoals, and The\nBasement Tapes out of their head. \n\nSetting out to make a record that no one could ever label as “slick,” their music has edges that make it human, and infinitely \nmore honest. That is evident from the opening track, “Rising Water,” as Luke Mitchell’s powerful voice emits, “Can’t Stand to die here, Working from morning till the day is dead, What good is money if you’ve got no friends?” With these lines, a theme emerges that weaves throughout the record: restlessness rooted in the need for change. Before The High Divers, frontman Luke Mitchell was playing for tourists 8 hours a day— singing other people’s songs for folks who really could care less—all while watching his friends live their musical dreams, and sprint down their creative path with no fear. Tired of being a spectator to this, The High Divers were formed and an escape plan was hatched. All four members moved to Charleston on the same day and began recording, “Riverlust” shortly after. “Riverlust” is an album about pursuing the things you love with reckless abandon. It’s a celebration of not giving up on your “kid dreams,” as mentioned in the song “Troubles.” \nThe history between the members existed long before the group became The High Divers. Luke (lead vocals and guitar) and Kevin Early (bass and backing vocals) played together in a 60’s and 70’s cover band at the ages of 14. Drummer Julius DeAngelis was recruited fresh out of high school by a Southern Rock band, and hit the road for a year of touring before joining up with Luke and Kevin. Mary Alice Connor joined the group just as the band arrived in Charleston, and filled the need for piano and additional vocals. With a wide range of influences, and thousands of hours logged, The High Divers create music that nods to the southern rebelliousness of Tom Petty, the raw beauty of Neil Young, and the genre clashing of Wilco, yet is leaning forward all the time.Quiet Hollers are a cult/gang/band from Louisville, KY formed semi-accidentally in 2010 following an album release party for which the band was recruited.  \n\nIn 2013, the band’s debut album I Am the Morning, a “reverb-soaked dive into the stream-of-consciousness confessionals” (No Depression) of singer/songwriter Shadwick Wilde featured a drummer whose neck was literally broken-- the band refusing to postpone their session at the since-defunct Funeral Home studio of analog guru Kevin Ratterman (Murder By Death, Andrew Bird, My Morning Jacket) after a waterfall-diving accident.\n\nAlthough the album was received with polite applause from the European blogosphere, and a smattering of indie music writers for whom it was a “Best of 2013,”  it flew mostly under the radar in the band's hometown of Louisville, KY despite rotation on WFPK and a nomination for best album in the inaugural Louisville Music Awards.\n\nBooking a slew of tours across the eastern half of the US (often using connections from Wilde’s days as guitarist-for-hire for seminal Dischord Records band Iron Cross), Quiet Hollers produced their sophomore full-length without label support... relying instead on a small but dedicated cult following who funded nearly the entire project.\n\nReleased in October 2015, \"Quiet Hollers\" runs the proverbial gamut of the band’s eclectic influences to deliver literate, hook-laden narratives, blasting through tube amps in swirls of violin and piano.

Until you think about it a while.\n\nThat’s what singer, guitarist and songwriter Ward Hayden did as he began mapping out plans for Girls Guns & Glory’s next album, which happens to be called Love and Protest.\n\n“That title sums up this album and it sums me up very well too,” he says. “We’ve done 10 years of touring, living, learning and growing, maturing and developing a broader world view, a view outside of the small town where I grew up.”\n\nThat decade began with Hayden and several like-minded musicians getting together. Their love for early rock ’n’ roll, true country, raw blues and pretty much any kind of authentic American music branded them quickly as anomalous — and electrifying. Since that time they’ve barnstormed far beyond their Boston hometown, playing honky-tonks, beer joints and more recently concert venues throughout the U.S. They’ve amassed a loyal legion of fans along the way. The media have noticed too, including Rolling Stone, which heralds them as a “modern-day Buddy Holly plus Dwight Yoakam divided by the Mavericks.”\n\nNow, in this milestone year, with Girls Guns & Glory recording for the first time on its own label, the group has channeled all it’s experienced into its most personal and, paradoxically, hardest-rocking release to date.\n\n“Love and Protest is the name of the album because its songs explore the emotion of love,” Hayden explains. “And when love is faced with opposition, it’s the protest of that emotion. It’s alpha and omega — love and protest. There’s a lot of ground to cover between those two extremes.”\n\nThey begin with the album’s first single and opening track. “Rock ’n’ Roll.” With bassist Paul Dilley and drummer Josh Kiggans laying down a no-nonsense, backbeat-driven groove, lead vocalist and guitarist Hayden sings, “I’m a hunter, a collector of things. I keep holding onto bad memories.” And yet, when the chorus hits, he proclaims that he’s “ready to rock ’n’ roll.”\n\nLike much of Hayden’s work, these lyrics run deeper than they seem at first listen, with a sub current of heartbreak and obsession. “I don’t just collect physical trinkets,” Hayden notes. “This song is more about experiences and memories, the things you can’t see but they stay with you in your head and your heart.\n\nSimilar spirits haunt the bitterly self-destructive “Wine Went Bad,” the loneliness of “Reno, Nevada” (“I might as well be a world away”), the exquisitely pure honky-tonk lament “Empty Bottles,” the painful introspection of “Memories Don’t Die” and “Stare at the Darkness,” and “Diamondillium,” a dystopian meditation shaded by noir guitar and incongruously inspired by an episode of Futurama — really, everything on the album, including its one cover, a resurrection of Gram Parsons’ “Hot Burrito No. 1.”\n\n“The growth and maturity of Girls Guns & Glory as a band is what led us to take on this song,” Hayden says. “Lyrically, I think it’s a song that would make Hank Williams proud. Love was, and is, there in the person telling the story, but his love interest has taken the things she’s learned from their relationship and moved on to someone else. The storyteller is left to pine over it. It’s love and protest exemplified.\nTo complement the immediacy of Hayden’s words, Girls Guns & Glory elected to cut Love and Protest entirely in analog, with Drew Townson, an acknowledged master of that format, recruited to produce with the band.\n\n“There’s a nostalgia to working with analog,” Hayden says. “There are also limitations — no editing, making sure you don’t run out of tape. But those limitations force you to let things go, let things happen. The anxiety begets beauty and makes the band do its best every take, firing on all cylinders and working together as a cohesive unit.\n\n“It’s as stripped-down as we’ve ever been. Even going into it, I didn’t imagine it would turn out as pure as it did.”\n\nGoing back to analog parallels the band’s return to its earliest days as an independent act, in control of its career. “This is the first album in eight years where we did everything ourselves,” Hayden says. “It’s the first album we’ve co-produced. We don’t worry about appeasing a label anymore. We’re creating music only for ourselves and our fans.”\nTo illustrate, he points to one track, “Man Wasn’t Made,” an affirmation that “man wasn’t made to just lie down and die,” set to a rollicking rockabilly beat and ignited by sparks of steel guitar. “When we were working with a label, they kept telling me that protest songs don’t sell so they didn’t want to put this kind of cut on a record. Well,” he says, smiling, “now we can sneak in a couple of actual protest songs, in a not-so-sly way.”\n\n“With this record, we feel almost like a brand new band,” he continues. “We take things in a different direction. A lot of that is because a shift has occurred on our tours. We’re getting out of the bars and playing more in theaters and listening rooms. Instead of just trying to keep people on the dance floor for three hours, we’re crafting songs for people who really like to listen. That’s allowed us to dig deeper lyrically, to make more mature music with a higher level of musicianship. We’re making the music we want to make. We’re not limiting it to any genre in particular. We’re willing to do whatever feels right.”\n\n“You could say,” Hayden concludes, “we’re a bigger part of the music itself than we’ve ever been.”\n\nNothing could be better news for those who have loved Girls Guns & Glory. Nothing can give more hope to all still waiting for their faith in real, honest-to-God American music to be restored."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Noah Guthrie","date":"08 30 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1520866","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1520866-noah-guthrie-charlotte/","desc":"With nearly half a million Facebook fans and over 66 million YouTube views, it’s easy to see why Noah Guthrie, a rising blues singer-songwriter has become one of the most talked about viral sensations in years.

Never one to stand still for very long Iain moved on during the 1970’s with another group, Plainsong an ensemble that allowed Iain to blossom as a songwriter and acoustic guitarist -  supported by his ex-Fairport mates Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson both in the studio and in Richard’s case on tour.

For The Secret Sisters, there was a point after the release of their last record when they could have chosen to do neither – instead, sinking to the bottom as the weight of the world washed away their dreams. They went from touring with Bob Dylan to losing their label, purging their team, filing bankruptcy and almost permanently trading harmonies for housecleaning. But there’s a mythical pull to music that kept sisters Laura and Lydia Rogers moving forward, and they came out with a biting and beautiful third LP, produced by Brandi Carlile, You Don’t Own Me Anymore. Their first as New West signees, it’s a document of hardship and redemption, of pushing forward when it would be so much easier to drown in grief. And it’s a story about how passion and pure artistry can be the strongest sort of salvation – how art is left, like perfect grains of sand, when everything else has washed away.\n\n“We are more proud of these songs than we have ever been,” says Laura. “Some of the songs are a little more cryptic, but some of them are very pointed and honest and direct. And we had to let those songs happen. We had to let ourselves be angry again, and bring up things we wanted to forget.” \n\nIt certainly would have been easier to just try and forget the past few years of The Secret Sisters’ life. After their second album, Put Your Needle Down, didn’t perform according to their label’s expectations – however unrealistic they were in this day and age – the duo was dropped, leaving them with barely enough money to stay on the road and keep making music. So they retreated home to Alabama, worn and weary from experiencing the devilish side of the industry first-hand, scraping together whatever they could while trying to embrace what seemed to be a future without music. But when Carlile – someone whom The Secret Sisters have admired for years and one of our truest talents – offered to produce their record, it made them think that a future was possible. Soon, a PledgeMusic campaign that completely exceeded their hopes and dreams made it fiscally so.\n\n“It was a nightmare that every day seemed to worsen,” says Laura. “We went through things we literally never thought we would come out of. “Adds Lydia, “it had just gotten so bad, the only option was to file bankruptcy.”\n\nEven once Carlile gave The Secret Sisters some renewed hope, things weren’t instantly easy: what they went through left huge, gaping wounds that needed to heal before they could pour themselves into songwriting. But when they did, everything changed. Laura and Lydia found themselves in a more creative and honest space than ever, with their experiences flowing and morphing into collective tales of triumph, rage and the indefatigable human spirit. The resulting songs of You Don’t Own Me Anymore are about life when everything you think defines you is stripped away: from “The Damage,” as gorgeous as it is haunting, that speaks directly to those that did them wrong, to the first single “Tennessee River Runs Low,” that imagines the willful flow of a powerful river. These are journeys as poetic as they are confessional, always anchored by the timeless, crystalline ring of Laura and Lydia’s voices in sweet unison.\n\n“This record is deeply personal because of what we endured,” says Lydia. “But it’s important as a songwriter and artist to talk about the times things weren’t great. This is a hard business, and it’s not all roses and rainbows. What we came out with is more honest than ever, and we couldn’t help that a lot of it is about the darkness.”\n\nIn the beginning, before that darkness moved in, things were a little like rainbows and roses for the sisters, who rose quickly through the music universe. An open audition in Nashville in 2009 lead them to a major label deal and a debut record produced by T Bone Burnett and Dave Cobb, followed by a tour with Levon Helm and Ray LaMontagne, a feat for any artist, let alone two that had just gotten started. From there, they opened for the likes of Dylan, Willie Nelson and Paul Simon, appeared on numerous late night shows and released a second album with Burnett. But the tides turned quickly – things can change in an instant, both for the good, and the bad. And when the clouds started to lift, Carlile was there to help usher in the sunshine.\n\n“Brandi, Phil, and Tim had never produced a record for anybody but themselves,” says Laura about their experience in the studio. “We are all artists, and we could include our opinions. I felt like everyone was an equal force in the room. It is often lost on producers that you actually have to go perform your song on a stage – it’s easy to get so caught up on the production that you don’t discuss how this all will translate – but Brandi innately understood that.” The end product finds the sisters taking their music to new places, with soulful, gospel grooves and stirring vocal deliveries that never seek perfection over power. From murder ballads to skewering roasts, it’s a guidebook for survival.\n\nAfter all, sometimes you have to lose everything to get a renewed version in return. Like the Tennessee River they sing about, only after a drought does fresh, new water come rushing in. The same could be said for The Secret Sisters, who were scraped dry and put through hell, coming out with their finest record, You Don’t Own Me Anymore. “The only way we could have completely healed was to have written an entire record,” says Laura. “I think we were just in the wrong parts of the machine,” says her sister. “We feel like we have learned where not to be, and where to go.” And that’s to never let anyone or anything own them again.“Honey, you ain’t got nothing to say. Go out there and live a little—come back to me in 10 years.”\n\nThose stinging words from a Nashville music executive to wet-behind-the-ears singer-songwriter Mary Bragg years ago couldn’t have stung more. But she took that blow-off advice into a journey that transformed the south Georgia native from pop-country wannabe into the striking, vulnerable voice she wears on her new album, Edge of This Town, drawing comparisons to Americana luminaries Patty Griffin and Shawn Colvin.\n\nBut her story, and her songs are her own.\n\n“I didn’t know it at the time, but a little rejection was just what I needed,” Bragg said.\n\nBarely out of high school, Bragg spent six months in Nashville as a sprite, eager singer, chasing the dream. Like so many do.\n\nSent on her way to the University of Georgia where she was classically trained in voice, she put Nashville behind her and focused on developing her craft on her own terms. After college, New York became her muse, her trouble, her chaperone. Several years into growing acclaim in Brooklyn’s Americana scene, she attracted overflow crowds for a yearlong residency at New York City’s famed venue The Living Room. She has been honored in such prestigious songwriting contests as Kerrville New Folk, Telluride Troubadour, Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, Wildflower! Festival, and the International Songwriting Competition.\n\nNow having recently been accepted into the world-renowned circle of songwriters at The Bluebird Cafe after a 60-second audition, Bragg finally has been embraced in Nashville. The 2011 release of her Lee Alexander-produced album Tattoos & Bruises, met with critical acclaim by USA Today, No Depression magazine and others, didn’t hurt.\n\nWith themes of longing, trying relationships, and wistfulness, the ethereal, alt-country Edge of This Town was released April 7. Bragg takes her listeners to nostalgic, emotional places through her pointed lyrics and powerful melodies. On the opening track, Bragg describes a woman unwilling to give up on her crumbling marriage. “Hollywood’ll say go on and walk away, that it ain’t worth all these tears, but Hollywood ain’t here,” Bragg sings, a lilting slide guitar bending its way across the evocative timbre of Bragg’s voice. She produced the EP together with guitarist Rich Hinman and her bassist/husband Jimmy Sullivan.\n\nBragg recorded the album after winning the inaugural BandPage/Zoo Labs Music Residency Contest, which enabled her to create the album at Zoo Labs Studios in Oakland, California in November 2014. This is Bragg’s fourth studio recording and her first since moving to Nashville in December 2013. The Zoo Labs Music Residency is an immersive program that supports entrepreneurial music-making teams in bringing their creative power to their business plans. Bragg brought her long-time band along to the Bay area for the experience – Jimmy Sullivan (co-producer, bass), Rich Hinman (co-producer, guitars), Mike Cassedy (piano, organ), Johnny Duke (mandolin, guitar), and Andrew Laubacher (drums).\n\nHer sophomore release, Sugar (2007), was produced by Darius Jones and recorded in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Her debut album, Certain Simple Things (2004), was co-written, engineered and produced in Athens, Georgia, by Dave Haywood (Lady Antebellum).\n\nWith more dates being added, her U.S. tour continues through 2015 with stops in Nashville, Atlanta, Knoxville, Greenville, Charleston, Cincinnati, New York City, Long Island, and Philadelphia."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"PHOEBE HUNT & THE GATHERERS","date":"09 23 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1542218","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1542218-phoebe-hunt-gatherers-charlotte/","desc":"An accomplished Americana instrumentalist with foundations in jazz and swing music, Phoebe makes an impressive creative leap with this record. It’s the culmination of a five year journey that has taken her from her Austin roots through Music Row, Brooklyn, and even to India to study with seventh-generation master violinist Kala Ramnath.  Along the way, Phoebe found her voice and delivered her most inspired set of songs to date — the soundtrack to her self-discovery.\n\nShanti’s Shadow marks an arrival for Phoebe Hunt, whose artistic and personal journey has deep storylines. These masterfully crafted songs are brought to life by the musicians Phoebe has gathered – each a virtuoso in their own right. Phoebe is skilled at taking seemingly disparate elements and pulling them together into a dazzling kaleidoscope of lush, coherent sound and rhythm patterns. The result is music that swells, crashes and breathes organically under Phoebe’s soulful, plaintive voice. Sounds of Americana and Texas Tinged Swing are woven with exotic rhythmic concepts culled from Phoebe’s time in India.\n\nShanti’s Shadow is always surprising yet comfortingly familiar.  Prior to recording this album, the entire band traveled to India to study at an ashram outside of Pune with master violinist Kala Ramnath. In India, they practiced music, meditation and philosophy – sometimes spending as many as 10 hours a day working and re-working Tats and Ragas. This intense, experiential study is apparent in the seamless musical play and improvisation of Shanti’s Shadow.“The purity of Dori Freeman’s voice and the directness of her songwriting reflect not only her Appalachian hometown — Galax, Va. — but also a determined classicism, a rejection of the ways modern country punches itself up for radio and arenas.” – Jon Pareles, The New York Times\n“A strong contender for Americana debut of the year” —Rolling Stone Country\n\nDori Freeman grew up in a family of bluegrass musicians, raised on a diet of Doc Watson and the Louvin Brothers. But by driving age, she’d cruise around her hometown of Galax, Virginia (pop: 7,042), windows down, breeze riffling her cropped strawberry-blonde hair, and harmonize with the pop melodies of singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson playing on her CD player. “I always thought that our voices sounded nice together,” Freeman says in a rough-edged, Appalachian twang. The feeling stuck with her, and at one point, Freeman did something odd for a 22-year-old single mom working at the family’s frame shop: she recorded a video of herself playing Thompson’s “Everybody Move It” and sent it to him via Facebook, with a note saying how much she liked to sing with him.\n\nThree days later, he wrote back.\n\nTwo years after that, The New York Times named Freeman’s self-titled debut—an honest and achingly beautiful collection of folk and country songs produced by Thompson and recorded in three days—one of the best albums of 2016. “The purity of Dori Freeman’s voice and the directness of her songwriting reflect not only her Appalachian hometown,” wrote the Times’ Jon Pareles in his initial review, “but also a determined classicism, a rejection of the ways modern country punches itself up for radio and arenas.”\n\nSo far, Freeman’s success owes as little to modern country as it does the standard career-building tools of young artists. No brand partnerships, an Instagram account that’s much more personal than promotional, though, yes, she’s still on Facebook. An unnervingly grounded 26, she states her goal as “try to make good music and hope people listen to it” with a sure finality. “I just hope that I can sustain a career doing this for the rest of my life.”\nShe definitely has good role models. Her dad and grandfather are respected bluegrass musicians, and growing up she traveled with them to fiddle conventions and folk festivals. “I spent a lot of nights at campsites as a kid, watching them and their friends take turns picking songs and jamming for a few hours,” Freeman recalls. Finally at 15 she picked up the guitar—specifically a small body guitar of her dad’s that had “this ridiculous Hawaiian print and wasn’t really meant to be played”—because she loved singing in the school chorus and wanted to be able to back herself up. Her first gig was with her dad, performing Doc and Rosa Lee Watson’s “Your Long Journey.”\n\nFreeman started writing her own songs—taking inspiration from Rufus Wainwright and Dolly Parton—after dropping out of Virginia Tech University and moving back home. By 22 she had a daugher, Osa, as well as plenty of heartbreak to serve as lyric fodder. “I pretty much always have a little baseline of melancholy going on,” she admits. Osa, surprisingly, ended up being the push Freeman needed to seriously pursue music. “Some people find it odd that you would not have much of a career and then have a baby and then the baby be the catalyst for wanting to have a career, but that’s what happened,” she says. “She changed my life and made me realize that if I wanted to do music, I had to do it full force and be confident about it. I had to do it for her, but also for me.”\n\nWhile Freeman’s debut hewed to love-gone-wrong songs, her new album, the more measured and maturely crafted Letters Never Read—again produced by Thompson and featuring guest appearances by his dad Richard Thompson, as well as Aiofe O’Donovan and Kacy & Clayton —has a distinctly rosier outlook. “I always want to put out something that’s a genuine representation of what I was going through at that point in my life,” says Freeman, noting that getting married last year to fellow musician Nick Falk (who plays drums and banjo on the album) made writing love songs much easier. She laughs. “I’m happier now in general.”\n\nThough her melancholy baseline’s holding strong. “Cold Waves” offers strikingly palpable telegrams from within depression (“Cold Waves, blue haze, that’s what it feels like, on the dark days,” she lilts over guitar and vibraphone) and her favorite song, “Lovers on the Run” is about being left behind: “I’ve spent many an hour writing letters never read/I’ve stared away the ceilings of a thousand lonesome beds.” The album title, Letters Never Read, comes from the idea of “writing songs about people in your past and maybe them never knowing that it’s about them,” she explains, “kind of like a letter never being read.”\n\nHonesty—in both writing and performance—seems almost reflexive in Freeman’s case.  “I don’t try to overdo any songs or put on big theatrics. I think simple is better.” It’s a reflection of her Appalachian roots, which she’s immensely proud of. “I think people have an idea of what this area in the country is like, and what that music sounds like, and it’s not necessarily a really nice picture that’s been painted. I want to break that stereotype down,” she says. “I’m proud of where I’m from. And I want to bring that kind of music to a new audience in a different way.”"},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"THE NATIONAL PARKS","date":"10 14 17","times":"\n  Doors: 10:00 pm / Show: 10:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1536980","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1536980-national-parks-charlotte/","desc":"The National Parks formed in Provo, Utah in early 2013.\n\nTo date, the band has released two full length albums (\"Young\" and \"Until I Live\") and one standalone single (\"As We Ran\" - written for the documentary film \"Love in the Tetons\")\n\nDespite operating as a true independent, the group's music has climbed to #13 on the iTunes singer/songwriter chart, top 50 on the iTunes’ Pop Chart, #5 on Billboard’s regional Heatseekers Chart, and has amassed over 10,000,000 Spotify streams.

Maybe he simply hadn't made the right record before.\n\nThis time, Lucca believes he has. It's his 8th full-length studio album, his first self-titled release, and first entirely self-produced effort.\n\n\"We went in with the intention of making a record that was as live-sounding as possible. I wanted to close my eyes and be able to visualize the players in the room or up on the stage, actually playing the songs together. One guitar over here, the other guy over there, bass, drums, some keys? I mean, that's the rock-n-roll I fell in love with when I was a kid.\" Lucca pulls inspiration from the heroes he heard on the radio growing up, from Tom Petty, Billy Squier to AC/DC's Angus Young, tapping into a sense of timelessness he places somewhere between The Black Crowes and the Black Keys.\n\nEach of the 12 songs on \"Tony Lucca\" are deeply personal. The record kicks off with \"Old Girl,\" Lucca's rebuff to the music business treadmill. On the upbeat \"Imagination\", Lucca recalls the evening where he met his wife... to the best of his ability. Lucca's fans will enjoy the diverse sonic quality of four of his trademark ballads -- the epic and sweeping piano-driven \"North Star\", the optimistic \"Smoke 'Em\", the push and pull of love lost and found in \"Right On Time\", and the sweet album closer that bares his daughter's name, \"Sparrow.\"\n\nFunded by a very successful Kickstarter campaign (one that hit its $25K funding goal just inside of 30 hours), Lucca feels strongly that his fans stepped up so that he could make the best record he possibly could -- one he could finally feel comfortable releasing with his own name as the title. To that point, Lucca says \"this record is pure. And honest. And hopefully completely refreshing to its listeners.\"\n\nTony Lucca was born on the outskirts of Detroit on the heels of Motown's heyday, raised within the loving confines of an enormous family of musicians; his mom was the 10th of 12 kids who all sang and played. At the ripe old age of 12, Tony had his first paying gig as a musician at a Jr. High School dance and by the age of 15, he parlayed his childhood rock-n-roll fantasy into a legitimate career, getting cast among an extraordinary group of newcomers on The All New Mickey Mouse Club, along with Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling and Britney Spears.\n\nShortly after graduating high school, Lucca wound up in LA and embarked upon an independent recording career that would span over 20 years. Along the way he's toured with artists as colossal as Maroon 5, Kelly Clarkson, *NSYNC and Marc Anthony, as well as several of his fellow Hotel Cafe kin including Josh Kelley, Sara Bareilles, Joey Ryan (Milk Carton Kids), Gabe Dixon and Andrew Belle. Lucca won the LA Music Award for best male singer/songwriter in 2001 and appeared numerous times on Last Call with Carson Daly, as well as The Wayne Brady Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Also in 2013, Lucca was the sole entertainment for FOX's NFL Thanksgiving Day telecast for the Detroit Lions vs. Green Bay Packers game.When Derik Hultquist declares, “my life is defined by parallel lines” one is tempted to assume he/she is listening to a road weary troubadour who is reflecting on a long musical journey of one night stands playing for tip jars. While Hultquist certainly hasn’t been exempt from these experiences, the twenty-something is sharing more of his narrative of life, than simply recounting his musical reality. An East Tennessee native, Hultquist has always been drawn to a life equal parts imagined as realized. \n\nAfter leaving Alcoa, TN he spent time at Kentucky Wesleyan College tending to the business of getting an education and defending the net as goalie for the men’s soccer team. After an injury left him sidelined with too much time on his hands, he fell back into the familiar practice of songwriting, which he had been mining since before high school. The next few years, while waiting on graduation, he spent reinvigorated with the art of the song. Upon graduation, on a whim, he migrated to Nashville. While this might seem like a cliche?d, predictable move, Hultquist didn’t show up ‘demo tape in hand’ and start beating on the doors of music row. He decided to make his own path and took on flexible jobs (legislative legal clerk, server, handyman, paperboy, pharmacy tech, valet, and others), which didn’t merit much income, but did allow him time enough to write everyday. He continued making an earnest attempt to craft his songwriting into a symbolic tale of the potential in all of humanity. From this writing spawned the self-released, Anthologies and Blue Blues. \n\nHultquist eventually did find his way to Carnival Music, a multi-faceted company who has established itself as one of the last holistic breeding grounds of the artist/writer in Nashville. Carnival released two EPs on Hultquist, Whether Report, in early 2012 and Leaning On The Rain, later the same year. These releases revisited a few songs on his previous self-released albums in the hopes of honing in on a definitive sound. “I’m a perfect stranger in a strange place,” he laments on “Cowboy Cliche?” a track off of the Whether Report set. With such a simple statement, Hultquist immediately invites the listener to identify with his plight. It’s his subtle reflectiveness that is at the core of these songs. \n\nOn his forthcoming release, Mockingbird’s Mouth, due out in February 2014, Hultquist builds on the cerebral nature of Whether Report and Leaning On The Rain almost seamlessly; transitioning from the stark atmospheric nature of the 2012 releases to a blithely journeyman’s account of past, present, and future. The opening track, “For The Good Of The Rose” situates itself exceptionally as the tone- setting cornerstone of the seven-song collection and tempts the listener to ponder what might have been if James Taylor had developed his sound in Laurel Canyon, CA. \n\nWhile the EP is loaded with imagery of life on the road, sonically, the set explores new territory for Hultquist. The upbeat “Give Me The Highway” beckons one to speculate what country radio might sound like if the ‘powers that be’ were willing to promote a more pensive agenda. The entire album juggles an introspective sentiment with an optimistic attitude, one that is certainly a testament to the values of Hultquist. It only requires a first listen to selections like “Strange Love” and “Stay Young” for one to realize he/she is witnessing a complexity that is created by a marriage eager anticipation and brooding carefulness. Hultquist beautifully assumes the role of storyteller on “#29.” He employs the four-minute vehicle to convey his observations of life, instead of letting it become just another train song. \n\nHultquist’s work could lead one to draw obvious comparisons to the likes of Jack Kerouac or John Steinbeck. After delving deeper into the crux of Hultquist writing, though, one might shift his/her semblance towards a Langston Hughes or Ernest Hemingway association instead, as witnessed when he closes the new project with his own spin on a love song with “Parallel Lines” and the meditative “Country Song.” In the closing number, when Hultquist asserts, “Questions don’t get clearer, just more often asked. If I knew the future, I’d still want to wait, to see if I use it before the past gets in the way” it unveils the spirit of Mockingbird’s Mouth, an album that summons a deeper examination of the ordinary."},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"An Evening With CALLAGHAN & JESSE TERRY","date":"11 10 17","times":"\n  Doors: 7:00 pm / Show: 7:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1541265","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1541265-evening-callaghan-jesse-charlotte/","desc":"When Callaghan moved from London to Atlanta during the summer of 2010, she was still a relatively unknown name in the States. A singer/songwriter whose music blurred the edges between pop, adult contemporary and Americana, she had been drawn to Atlanta by one of her biggest influences - Shawn Mullins - after he had agreed to produce her first album. It was a classic story of taking risks, of willingly throwing your life into upheaval in order to chase your dreams.\n\nJust a few years later, Callaghan’s writing a second chapter of that success story. On her second album, A History of Now, she draws upon four years of touring, recording and growing appreciation in the U.S. She's transformed herself from a burgeoning indie songwriter — playing to 20 people at her first US show — to a full-fledged headliner who's toured across 46 states, played the Cayamo Cruise, performed at packed venues around the country and logged more than 50,000 highway miles per year. Along the way, she's developed a close connection with her fans, even booking a series of cross-country tours consisting of nothing but shows in people’s homes.\n\nIt was her very first house show tour — which stretched from coast-to-coast in 2013, a year after the release of her widely-acclaimed debut album, Life in Full Colour — that earned Callaghan a four-page spread in Billboard Magazine.\n\nThe magazine credited her with \"helping reshape the business of touring, if not music consumption entirely,\" and praised Callaghan for her strong vocals and do-it-yourself work ethic. The Huffington Post agreed, adding, \"She's one of those performers whose genuine sweetness is transparent in her voice, and it shines through her writing.\"\n\nPlaying her fans' living rooms has allowed Callaghan to put herself in direct contact with her audience, erasing the boundaries that often exist between musicians and their fans — and allowing her to compete on the same level as bands backed by major labels. In 2014, while raising money to record A History of Now she turned to her own fans for help. They responded with overwhelming support, sending in more than 300 donations via a wildly successful PledgeMusic campaign.\n\nThat connection is more evident than ever in A History of Now, whose songs reflect moments and experiences from Callaghan's own life, as well as stories that people have shared with her. Rather than make the album strictly biographical, Callaghan's songs are written in a more universal way, allowing her audience to connect the songs to their own lives. On \"Who Would I Be,\" one of the album's many highlights, she pays tribute to those supporters, thanking them for allowing her music to enter their lives and for enabling her to do what she loves. Meanwhile, \"Crazy Beautiful Life\" — the album's lead single — celebrates the joys found in the sheer unpredictability and exuberance of life, and \"Best Year\" — a re-recording of a bouncy, breezy song that also appeared on Life in Full Colour — is a seize-the-day anthem aimed at anyone who's longed to \"tear up the rulebook, leave it all behind... and find some bluer skies.\"\n\nIn the spirit of working together, A History of Now is a team effort, recorded in Nashville with producer Dennis Matkosky (a songwriting legend whose credits include Keith Urban's \"You'll Think of Me\" and the Flashdance soundtrack's \"Maniac,\" as well as several co-writes on the Callaghan album) and instrumental contributions from some of Nashville's best session players. Casey Brown, a member of Owl City, made loops for several songs, adding a modern edge to the album's analog vibe. Still, on a record filled with musical all-stars, Callaghan is easily the most impressive player, singing all 12 songs in a sweet, soaring voice that booms and breaks at all the right moments. If Life in Full Colour was an album about chasing dreams, then A History of Now is an album about achieving them.\n\n\"We are all, right now, writing a story which will one day fascinate someone,\" Callaghan says. \"The way we live, the decisions we make, and the moments of hope, grief and happiness which punctuate all our lives will one day make someone stop, think and wonder. All of us are writing our own 'history of now.’”On the eponymous title track of Stargazer, the lushly orchestrated and existentially optimistic fourth LP from singer/songwriter Jesse Terry, the notion of personal unhappiness is framed in terms of a cosmic choice: “Go on stargazer, I know how much it hurts / But you are free now to pick your universe.” Infused with the warmth of a beautifully arranged string quartet and the otherworldly tremor of a lap steel guitar, “Stargazer” unfurls as a melodic Zen koan, a deep intuition all of us have at one point or another that the extent of our suffering — no matter its apparent source or point of origin — is largely up to us. The world’s frequent brutality and indifference are undeniable facts of life, facts that can feel oppressive and impenetrable. True freedom inheres in our ability to choose hope — to pick resilience over recrimination, optimism over oblivion. Taking that timeless and hard-won kernel of wisdom as his starting point — the recognition that hopelessness is the worst kind of human prison —  Terry’s lustrous, earnest Stargazer is precisely the kind of record we need in these seemingly hopeless times.\n\nIn a period of American life considered the most divisive and tribalistic in modern memory, the notion of hopefulness may feel misplaced to some. For Terry, though, it’s a byproduct of his own life experience. “I think I will always be innately hopeful, because I’ve seen how much life can change,” he says.  “And I’ve seen how much people can change, if they open up and allow themselves to do so.” After a turbulent adolescence defined by runaway shelters and reform schools, Terry grew up encountering other people in increasingly desperate situations. He credits the health of his outlook today to the pain he shared with others all those years ago. “I’m only happy because I know how difficult life can be. And then I become even more grateful, because even though I’ve traveled down some dark roads, I’ve met many more that have had it so much worse,” he says.  “People whose lives were devoid of love or light, without any family or without families that cared.” When he awoke hooked up to machines in a hospital bed in the aftermath of a substance-fueled binge at 18 years old, Terry says he realized that happiness is a choice, and he vowed to begin making it daily.  At a certain point, he says, a vision of what happiness would look like took hold in his mind. “I feel like I’ve been on that path for a long time now,” he says. “There always was a tiny spark in the shadows, even at my lowest points. If you’re working on it, the light gets brighter every day. Now I’m in a place that I love, with a wife that I love, with family in my life that I love. But it took a long while.”\n\nAround that time in his life, Terry’s mother lent him her old acoustic guitar — it was love at first pluck. Songwriting became a codified means for him to discover who he was, and he dropped out of art school to pursue it full-time. Though he had been on a path to become a painter, he says there was something vital in music that was missing in visual art. “Fine art at that time felt more like a chore than a gift,” he says. “I knew that I had some talent there with visual art, but it didn’t save my life like music did. I never needed it to survive.” Music had always been a part of Terry’s life, however. His earliest musical memories were the sounds emanating from his parents’ turntable: the Beatles, Roy Orbison, the Beach Boys, Electric Light Orchestra (sounds that, not coincidentally, largely inform the sonics of Stargazer). Both his parents had beautiful singing voices and were part of a successful local duo until they divorced when he was five. His father maintained a recording studio of one sort or another throughout Terry’s childhood, and he would often let his son record vocals on tracks. It wasn’t until he began writing his own songs that Terry truly began to realize music’s capacity to heal. Though he had turned to the Beatles and James Taylor for healing and guidance through some of the most difficult seasons of his own life, he realized that songwriting gave him that same capacity for connecting with another troubled soul. More powerful still was the realization that his songs might be able to help others heal. “At a certain point I realized that I might have the chance to ease someone else’s pain with my music, which is a much more powerful and humbling thing,” he says. “So I consider myself very lucky if the experiences that I went through gave me some empathy and helped me connect with other human beings at a foundational level – to understand some of that struggle and some of that resilience.”\n\nStargazer is very much an album representing the arc of that journey. Forged in the crucible of the artist’s earnest engagement with a chaotic, confusing world, the record is wonderfully difficult to classify. Drawing inspiration from a diverse pool of influences — from vintage Jeff Lynne-produced pop to the Roy Orbison of “In Dreams” to The Man Who-era Travis — Stargazer is an album commensurate with its moment, imbued with an unconquerably hopeful perspective. “I will always go back to hope and lean on that, because that’s what has gotten me here in the first place,” Terry says. Produced with multi-instrumentalist collaborator Josh Kaler in Nashville’s sumptuous EastSide Manor Studios, every aspect of the album went through an intentionally rigorous evaluative process. “Josh and I worked in the studio for months, making sure that we were bringing something fresh to every track, some kind of new sound or new harmony line or new string line,” Terry says. “I wanted Stargazer to be arranged and produced like the records I first fell in love with.” A significant part of that production process involved strings and renowned arranger Danny Mitchell. “I’ve worked with great string players in the past, but this is the first album where I’ve had the strings professionally arranged for a quartet,” Terry says. The inherent magic, power, and emotion in Mitchell’s arrangements are palpable throughout the record. “I wrote many of these songs with the strings in mind, knowing that they’d be taking my songs to new places.”\n\nOne need only listen to the soaring chorus of track “Woken the Wildflowers” to understand what Terry means. Begun while on holiday in New Zealand with his kiwi wife in the wake of the 2017 Women’s March, the song is a tribute to the renewal of American ideals made manifest that day. “Those are the American values that we read about in grade school – equality, justice, decency, freedom, truth – and I loved seeing millions of people across the world standing up for those beliefs,” Terry says. “I wanted to honor that in song.” Undergirding the chorus’ gentle call to “Wake up, wake up, wake up,” the strings swell with the possibility of regeneration felt across the world that day.\n\nStargazer is notable, too, for the diversity of its sonic palette. Terry is as adept at cross-pollinating spacey rockabilly with power pop (“Dance in Our Old Shoes”) as he is at writing dreamy, Beatles-esque ballads about a loved one’s toxic personality (“Kaleidoscope”); as comfortable at the helm of a charging, Springsteen-down-South ode to the new Nashville (“Runaway Town”) as he is singing a heartbreakingly tender lullaby to a European capital (“Dear Amsterdam”). “People, myself included, are always trying to categorize music into specific genres and I really wanted to avoid thinking that way while making this record,” he says. “In fact, the term ‘genre-less’ became a bit of a mantra for me as I was writing and recording Stargazer.”\n\nThe result is a record representing a clarity of vision and a creative pinnacle that, for Terry, has been a career in the making. The countless hours logged on the road and in the studio, he says, have primed him for this moment. “I’ve loved the slow and steady arc my career has taken, the places around the world it’s taken me and the people it’s put in my path,” he says. “Two years ago, even a year ago, I wasn’t ready to make this album.”\n\nHe remains anchored to the raw wonder he felt when first picked up his mother’s guitar all those years ago, to the period in his life when an optimist emerged from the black fog of early tribulations.\n\n“Everything feels like it’s happening at the right time.”"},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"One Love NOLA Tour: Dust Bowl Faeries, Twiggy Branches, Patchwork Symphony","date":"09 23 17","times":"\n  Doors: 10:00 pm / Show: 10:30 pm ","ticketfly":"1542701","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1542701-one-love-nola-tour-dust-bowl-charlotte/","desc":"Dust Bowl Faeries is a gothic-folk ensemble with a dark cabaret twist.

It's smart pop with an authentic Americana stamp, not the other way round. Oh yeah, somewhere in there they got married, but they'd rather not talk about that.The energy of rock n' roll is impossible to categorize – mercurial, specific to its beholder and profoundly reflective.\n\nFormed in 2005, the band spent four years playing just about anywhere they could. \"We just wanted to be able to play for any crowd and turn heads,\" says banjo player Joe Kollar. \"We played everywhere. Coffee houses, bars, churches, rock clubs, Bluegrass festivals and the streets…a lot on the streets. We didn't make any money, but what we learned was invaluable.\"\n\nFrom the Binghamton, New York music scene comes Driftwood, a band with a rock 'n' roll soul and a folk art mind. Carving out a name for themselves with electrifying live performances, they bring one of the most unique, raw sounds to the Americana/roots music scene. Incorporating upright bass, banjo, acoustic guitar and violin, the ghost of traditional American folk music lives in their palette. But the melodies, the harmonies and the lyrics are something else entirely.\n\nIn November 2012, Driftwood started work on their third and latest CD. Despite a grueling tour schedule and very little time at home, the recordings were finished in the summer of 2013. The self-titled new disc was recorded in a church outside of Ithaca, NY with Grammy-winning engineer Robby Hunter. It was released on December 3rd, 2013.\""},{"venue":"Evening Muse","event":"Koo Koo Kanga Roo","date":"11 28 17","times":"\n  Doors: 5:30 pm / Show: 6:00 pm ","ticketfly":"1524341","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.eveningmuse.com/event/1524341-koo-koo-kanga-roo-charlotte/","desc":"Koo Koo Kanga Roo is the dance-a-long comedy show from Bryan and Neil, two friends who set out to experiment with live music and make it more fun.

Formed in 2010 by singer/keyboardist Colby Dobbs after an attempt to record a solo album with studio musicians, Dobbs found chemistry and musicianship in Dan Lawlor (drums) and David J. Sentendrey (bass) – with each adding their own sound to the collective. Marcus Harmon and Charlie Trexler would later be added on saxophone and guitar, respectively, to round out the group's identity. Between CDB's members, there is a wide array of musical influences, ranging from classic artists like Steely Dan and Stevie Wonder to more current pop acts like Jamiroquai. CDB's central focus is and always has been on good songwriting and precise musicianship, which has led to the band developing a sound that is truly unique for their time and place. “We think the songs are certainly the most important thing. I think at the end of the day, most people love good songs and truly appreciate them,” Dobbs says. Considered one of the best bands in North Carolina by the influential music reviewers Live Limelight, CDB released their full-length debut album, “The Great Unknown,\" in June 2012, which is now available for purchase/download worldwide. The group's live performances have not only gained them notoriety in their hometown of Charlotte but throughout music rooms they have worked across the southeast region of the United States."}];
