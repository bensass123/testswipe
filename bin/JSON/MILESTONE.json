With a compositional map that is strict in form yet malleable in execution, Kayo Dot uses a vast array of instrumentation to create an exciting convergence of violence and serenity.&quot;<br>Since then, Kayo Dot&apos;s music has undergone several identity shifts, largely influenced by the band&apos;s constantly-changing lineup and instrumentation.

This lends to the music the element of &quot;malleability&quot; mentioned in Tzadik&apos;s description above.<br>The music of Kayo Dot is commonly categorized as post-metal, post-rock, progressive rock, or avant-garde.

After the release of their self-released full length album, Yikes, the band has been hitting the road and getting acquainted with the van - and now two tours, three blown tires, a branded hot sauce, and a family-size box of Tums later, they&#x2019;re ready to do it again. This may not last forever, but for now, while there&#x2019;s still a tinge of hopelessness in the air, Dollar Signs needs to party with you, because it&#x2019;s the only way to survive the times.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1512578\">Buy Tickets</a></p>","ticketfly":""},{"venue":"The Milestone Club","event":"Forges, Ol' Sport, Pet Peeves, The Chroma Divide","date":"07 23 01","times":"","tuneStub":"","href":"","desc":"<p>Forges is from Baltimore.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1519290\">Buy Tickets</a></p>","ticketfly":""},{"venue":"The Milestone Club","event":"The AWARD WINNING BEACH FORMAL 6!

They have been playing long enough to know better. PPR formed in the summer of 2002 at &quot;the farm,&quot; a cabin in the woods owned by Brian&apos;s family. Not much was actually farmed there except insanity, which requires no watering and minimal upkeep. The band wrote much of the material for their self titled EP at the farm. Following the exodus from and subsequent burning/destruction of the farm PPR wrote and recorded Diarrhea, a 34 song blast which is awesome but a little hard for some people to take. The band did a tour of the east coast to support the album, as well as countless shows closer to Atlanta. Trying to follow up Diarrhea proved difficult, with the band recording two unreleased albums, one acoustic and one electric. Original drummer Alex Picca left Atlanta around this time, and the drum chair was filled by Chris Costello. At this point Chris was playing with local band Dented, and Spencer was occupied playing with the also local band Sovus Radio. Following the demise of both of these bands PPR regained focus, and recorded material for their next two albums at the world famous Milestone Club in Charlotte, NC. The music from this marathon recording/drinking session was divided into two parts, &quot;Crab,&quot; an instrumental surf EP, and &quot;Breakfast&quot; a heavy and somewhat experimental album. PPR recently completed their latest album, &quot;the robot destroyer: part 1,&quot; recorded and produced by Jason Nesmith. Drummer Chris Costello left the band soon after completing &quot;Robot Destroyer,&quot; prompting the return of Alex Picca. PPR is happy now, and that&apos;s all that matters.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1471963\">Buy Tickets</a></p>","ticketfly":""},{"venue":"The Milestone Club","event":"Bitter Inc., The Emotron, Pray 4 Triangle Zero, Camping","date":"07 13 01","times":"","tuneStub":"","href":"","desc":"<p>The modern music industry creates serious distortions in the artist as a result of capitalism. Marx described perfectly the alienation of the worker from his product, and especially the ultra-specialization of each worker into their own unique class. The industry tries to force artists into single genres. Every artist is supposed to be &quot;marketable&quot; which means conforming to a specific pre-made mold. Even the &quot;alternative&quot; clubs seem to cater only to a &quot;specific crowd&quot; not wanting to challenge them. I have been shunned from punk clubs for being atypical just as much as I have been shunned from acoustic and pop clubs. It&apos;s why I don&apos;t CALL myself punk- at the moment it becomes a factory-repeatable pressing, it loses its vitality. I&apos;m sorry, people, you&apos;re just going to have to take what I give you. You get a catchy melody; that&apos;s my concession. But the music is mine to make. Any real radicals or rebels left (if they&apos;re out there) should appreciate what I do immediately. I don&apos;t want your shrink-wrapped electric guitar rock any more than I want to play shrink-wrapped techno pop.
